The reality is compounding interest is a huge factor in wealth accumulation.  The saying is your first million or whatever amount is the hardest.  Things such as better education, investments, and financial literacy are all things that will help the gap.  They won't magically close it, but complaining doesn't close it either.  The reality is time is the only thing that can really heal this wound without an expansive and frankly largely racist reparations policy.",

They provide very little substance as they seek to address these \"myths\" and in my opinion always miss the point. While yes financial literacy and schooling are likely not the solution for a wealth gap issue, but they are very likely part of any solution for a wealth gap issue. \n\nThe one that really aggravates me in this article is how they looked at the \"myth of closing the racial wealth gap through stronger families\" and then proceed to compare black women to white women. You are seeking to disprove that stronger family units with both a mother and father present is going to help their children succeed and break out of the cycle of poverty by comparing white women to black women. Why don't you compare black households with two parents and black households with one parent? Seems like a more accurate comparison to see if that \"myth\" really exists. And it is pretty much accepted that growing up in a single parent household puts children at a disadvantage and increases the likelihood that they will drop out of school and get involved in criminal activity. Now is addressing the issue of single parenthood going to solve the wealth gap? Not by itself, but it is also part of any solution to address poverty in general.",

It requires more than that to be racist.\n\nBut let's address your point....I am in the same boat as you, my grandparents moved here post-1900.  My family had nothing to do with slavery, many/most white Americans didn't.\n\nBut the goal of reparations isn't punishment and if it were done, it wouldn't be levied against white people alone, it would be a national/state/local budgetary decision.\n\nNow, yes, your taxes and my taxes would contribute to the reparations, but it's not designed as a punishment.  And yes, we'd be treating people differently because of their race.\n\nBut the argument FOR reparations is that national policy (allowing slavery) is a major contributing factor for black americans entering a cycle of poverty that still disproportionately affects them to this day.  It's not about white people being punished, it's about the entire nation (the one our families moved to) admitting that national actions caused harm.\n\nSo....let's stop calling it racist, stop calling it a punishment and discuss it for what it is....i think there are lots of rational reasons to oppose reparations, but you're not making those arguments.\n\n*Edit: There is a curious obsession here with insisting that just because race is part of a law, that makes the law \"racist\".   That has never been the case.  There are differences between \"racially disparate impact\", \"systemic racism\" and \"racism\"....they're a venn diagram, but y'all are trying to make them all have the same meaning.  Nuance is lost in this thread.*",

Taken together this paints a pretty clear picture that wealth distributions today would be only weakly, if at all, correlated to slave ownership. \n\nI in any case, let's say there existed a principled way to compute reparations owed, why stop at the US government? Surely we should be compensating Irish and Italian immigrants whose parents experienced discrimination within the modern era. What about the debt owed by modern descendants of the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole tribes who all benefited from slave labor even past the end of the civil war? Or the reparations owed by the modern day West African descendants of the Ashanti Empire (Ghana) whose economy and wealth derived to no small extent by their sale of enslaved rivals to colonial powers. Indeed, the country of Italy has considered itself the spiritual successor of Rome who famously enslaved millions from across Europe. I would imagine virtually everyone in the United States counts themselves at least related to someone affected by those crimes.\n\nWhat of these debts, how shall we adjudicate them?",

Think of it this way, if descendants of people who lived generations ago are entitled to a benefit, what about the descendants of people who committed crimes against that first group decades ago?  Would you punish the descendants for crimes of the forefathers?  What is racism if it's not thinking of people as parts of a group, which would include descendants of the same tribe?\n\nAlso, what about seeking reparations from descendants of Africans who captured and sold other Africans into slavery?  Should some African nations be made to pay reparations?\n\n&gt; The wealth and greatness of our nation was in-part built on the back of slaves, who did not get their share of that wealth for the work they performed.\n\nNot really; that's a popular bromide.  The amount of wealth in existence today has to be hundreds of times what existed 150 years ago.  The wealth we have today is based primarily on technological advance and work performed more recently over the past few decades.  To the extent our wealth is based on work done 150 years ago, it's only really attributable to past scientists and engineers who fostered technological advanced and not people performing manual labor.\n\n&gt; Being paid the value for work performed, that was unjustly denied, falls plainly under valid legal restitution theories.\n\nThe problem is that the people who performed the work are long since dead as are the people that directly benefited from it.  There are no victims left alive to compensate and no perpetrators left alive to take the money from.  Also, the manual labor that was done over 150 years ago really wouldn't have much value today.\n\nAmerican blacks are not the only group that has suffered injustice in the past.  Descendants of Irish immigrants could argue that the UK owes them reparations.  Descendants of Armenians could argue that Turkey owes them reparations.  Descendants of some Indian tribes could argue that descendants of the Aztecs owe them compensation.  Descendants of Jews could argue that Europe and Russia (and maybe most of the world?) owes them reparation for pogroms committed against them in the past, descendants of American Chinese immigrants could argue they are owed reparations for discrimination they suffered hundreds of years ago, etc.  Where would seeking reparations for historical wrongs end?\n\nUnfortunately, as a practical matter it's going to be impossible to make amends in any sort of a just way.

      "text": "&gt; a major factor at the root of the wealth gap.\n\nIt might be a factor that affected people in the past, but today it's a minor factor and by far the biggest factor is going to be the decisions people made in their lives individually.  The biggest problem the black lower class is suffering is self-inflicted.  Out-of-wedlock pregnancy, not raising children to value education and to have a work ethic (poor parentage), drug and alcohol abuse, and black-on-black crime.  The collective failure to choose to be a \"model minority\" is by far the biggest collective problem, and it's self-inflicted.  (Those same problems negatively impact people of all races, too, in collective groups and/or individually, if they choose to suffer from them.)\n\nIt's far easier to blame an all encompassing evil white racist conspiracy that no longer exists and to try to shake down the nation for reparations than it is to look inward.  Conservative black commentators who have expressed similar views have been shouted down as I'm sure I will be.  I'll probably be called a racist for this post when I would argue that I oppose racism and advocate individualism.",

I do think that yes, we can and should talk about race in America, albeit how we should go about it should be held in consideration. I do recall talking about this with someone else (who happened to be Asian) and this was their thoughts:\n\n\n&gt;I'm fairly on board with the idea that we all do have a responsibility to look at the inequities in both policing and social/business opportunities and ask why we've let the really obvious ones persist for so long, and I also think nudging those in our circles to do the same examination could be productive.\n\n\n&gt;I don't think painting people who haven't gotten to that point yet as the enemy does anything but make them dig their heels in more. And reframing our views of big issues like this takes time - we can't assume everyone will be on the same timeline, and while I don't think it's acceptable to use that as an excuse for a problematic status quo, I also think pushing for a quicker fix than \"hey, think about what you've historically enabled and if you don't like what you see, modify your actions\" is pretty much just going to result in more fragmentation.\n\n\n&gt;That said, I actually am on board with the idea that there need to be some ideologues and true believers pushing the conversation - I just think there's a lot of damage from applying their talking points as purity tests to the larger pool of moderates/not-yet-believers.",

This shit didn't stop with the Emancipation Proclamation, it has been continuous up through the present day.\n\nAlmost every community faces some or other form of discrimination from others. So, if you are talking about just discrimination, then you cannot highlight only black folks as victims. Furthermore, you cannot propose solution that takes money from non-black Americans (including many races/ethnicities that played little to no part in slavery) for black Americans. \n\nThe problem is that you are not only talking about only black related issues (slavery), but also about discrimination that affects others as well. \n\nFurthermore, there are many laws and practices in use now that are to compensate/balance out/make up things to black people (college and school admissions for example), that ends up hurting other minorities that were not even in the US during the slavery era.",

You will know the difference because it talks the superiority of a particular race.\n\nHere's what I obtained on the first hit:\n\n*prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.*\n\n*the belief that different races possess distinct characteristics, abilities, or qualities, especially so as to distinguish them as inferior or superior to one another.*\n\nThat seems fairly close in terms of abstract concept to Rand's definition.  So what do you take issue with in regards to how Rand defined it?\n\n&gt;Group C is the responsible party and that would be the government that allowed the violation of black citizens'rights. The American government never died and the American government will pay reparations like it has done for other groups.\n\nThe American government has changed dramatically over time and most importantly the people it represents who fund it have changed.  People from 150 years ago are long since dead as are any of the politicians that composed it.  The government even fought a long and expensive war against rebel factions to enforce changes it had made.  It's really not the same government any longer.  The people who fund and manage the government are completely different.\n\n&gt;By having an economist determined the damages which has been done multiple times already.\n\nIf the basic premise is flawed (aka racism), it doesn't matter how many \"economists\" attempt quantification.  If individuals alive today can demonstrate that they have been specifically damaged unjustly in a quantifiable manner, I'd be in favor of the government paying their damages.  But that's the problem; it's being based on racial group identity and not on individual grievances.  If someone was wrongfully imprisoned or overtaxed, then by all means I'm in favor of compensation.\n\nAlso, while considering \"damages\" we also need to contemplate \"benefits\".  If we go back far enough we might have to look at how descendants of slaves are doing in the United States relative to how they would have fared had the slaves been left in  Africa.  Some may have had their ancestors enslaved by other Africans or their ancestors could have been killed in tribal warfare, or they could have died from Malaria or other illnesses that could have been prevented with American medicine and sanitation, etc.\n\n&gt;&gt;It could be argued that many descendants of slaves are better off living in the United States today and have a better life here than they would have had in Africa. How do we account for that?\n&gt;\n&gt;No that can't be argued at all because that's silly. Black Americans live in third world conditions within America right now... lol.\n\nBlack Americans are not monolithic.  Some live in poor conditions as do many white people.  Some may have made poor decisions and damaged themselves as have many white people.  Many also enjoy first world conditions and have benefited tremendously from being here relative to how they would have fared in Africa, and many of those who are poor still have more opportunity than they would have had in many if not most African countries.\n\nThere's a reason people want to leave Africa and come to the United States and not the other way around.  However, if anyone feels they would be better off in Africa, I would be in favor of having the government foot one-way first class tickets in exchange for someone renouncing their U.S. citizenship.\n\n&gt;I am referring to the reparations that the American government paid to the families of lynching victims. Don't worry, I see you dodging that fact because you don't have a way to rebuttal.\n\nI don't understand what this has to do with Italians.  What was your point again about Italians and what are you saying I'm not rebutting and dodging?",

However, it is simplistic to blame this level of wealth gap soley on a lower starting point - or at least concluding that a massive transfer of wealth will result in this situation stabilizing.\n\nCurrently, African Americans suffer from [downward inter-generational mobility](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/race_paper.pdf) (an issue shared with Native Americans, but not shared with Whites, Hispanics or Asians) -- unless a wealth transfer fixes this issue (and you could argue it might help), the wealth discrepancy would just re-emerge after a couple generations.\n\nAnd this isn't solely post 1965 immigration selection (#9).  An interesting case study of this is analyzing two highly racially targeted groups (Asians and Black people in California pre-WW2) - and it turned out Asians (again the CA born ones) emerged post civil rights era with much more [upward mobility](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22748.pdf).\n\nI don't claim to know what causes the continued existence of this discrepancy - certainly may be lingering racism, stereotype threats, etc.  But unless a wealth transfer solves the mobility issue, it's an ephemeral solution.",
