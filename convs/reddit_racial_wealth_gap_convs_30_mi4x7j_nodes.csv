I still feel like he really doesn't want to cancel any debt, especially via executive, but I don't think the door is closed, and with Schumer continuing to be vocal about this it's not just a ""progressives"" issue that will go away.",0.3208

This sort of sweeping move should be decided by the legislature, due to its large financial impact. I don't see how ANY president doing this would be part of a democratic process, it just seems very overreaching. 

I think Congress definitely needs to prioritize making college affordable again, but a one-time loan forgiveness doesn't solve the root of the problem. It also only benefits people who went to school and took out loans; so if a person skipped college because they couldn't afford the loans, this really doesn't benefit them or give them a chance to improve their circumstances. Efforts need to be focused on equity and affordability, not loan forgiveness by the executive branch.",0.6932

For example, upon receiving a degree, a person can go online and give this federal office some info on what student loans they have, what the magnitude and interest rate of the loans is, how much is still owed on them.

This could optionally be combined with additional info provided by the person about what kind of school they went to (public/private, instate/out of state), what field their degree is in, if they have already received a job in that field, if so where in the country are they working, etc.

Perhaps with all this information the government could dispense one time aid to people over multiple administrations. The size of the debt forgiveness could be tailored to each applicant.

For example maybe doctors(who already incur very high levels of debt to go to medical school) could receive more than others based on their need. Perhaps beyond that a doctor who is practicing now in a rural area gets more as well(specialty medical care in rural America is alarmingly poor and not getting better).

Conversely, someone who decided to study studio art or english literature and hasn't found a job in those fields would receive less(but would always receive some support).

The way i imagine it, anyone who files could perhaps expect to have at least 10% of the debt forgiven.

There are obviously some gaping holes in this hypothetical. For starters it does not address the core problem of rising university costs which many are forced to pay. ongoing government aid to the point that it is expected could just make the problem worse.

Theoretically this hypothetical federal office could be quite strict with its ""grading"" when it comes to graduates of certain schools being generously forgiven or not. ie state universities who play ball with feds on reducing tuition costs could expect higher rates of debt forgiveness for their students and thus be more competitive and attractive to students. Ideally a university who is greedy with tuition would be flagged as such in this application process and would develop a negative reputation among potential students.

Or maybe having the feds involved with judging the value of a persons education vs other possible degrees, and judging the agreeableness of state universities is just a terrible idea IDK.",-0.5239

For example, there is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Process, but it is a very old system and it's so strict and at times difficult to understand that many people don't actually get the debt cleared. I think if they could improve that program and better publicize it, that'd be a positive step. 

The only difficulty I see comes in with changing administrations and funding. You'd want to try and build it with some safeguards so that loan policy doesn't keep switching every 4 years.",0.8979
