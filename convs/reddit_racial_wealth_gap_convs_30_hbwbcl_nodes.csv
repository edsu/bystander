I've held an opinion for a long time now, that if we stop making it an issue it will stop being an issue. 

Most people just want to get on and don't judge people at all. But you know what they really don't like? When someone constantly makes everything about race and colour.

You have to face issues head on rather than running away from them.

There's numerous studies and analysis showing that things can impact different races and groups in different ways. Of course society will have an interest in discussing and trying to resolve these issues. It's in everyone's interest to live in a fair society.",0.7579

I imagine the growth in BAME is coming from immigration.  If this is from poorer countries you would expect them to be coming in at the lower, poorer classes. 

Are they being systematicky kept down ? My guess is no, not at a race level. I don't think we are good at social mobility... And that probably pre dates lathe scale migration",0.3094

There's a risk with looking at in from a BAME only lens we miss real solutions. Of course it may be solving for BAME translates to solving for all.  But understanding the cause not correlation s are needed to solve properly. 

Focussing on police behaviours will do little if it is class related  Because at a rediculously stupid level, I could solve for arrest numbers by training police to blind eye 7 out of 8 BAME crimes.  No one is going to be impressed by that even if we get proportionate numbers.

I'm telling you as a person whose daily work requires data based decision. Data is important but so are qualitative measures, so is analysis. I would discourage following numbers blindly.

I wouldn't go as far as formulating the policy. I don't know if UK's police is racist systematically or not. What I'm trying to say is that if  people of a particular skin color have universally worse outcomes, they are without a doubt underprivileged and so it should be looked into.

To your point, poor people have dismal outcomes too, and white working class boys are just a subclass of those. We don't call it discrimination, but no matter how you put it they are on the receiving end of inequality and should be helped perhaps by reducing inequality.

However, poor and BAME are two distinct groups, somewhere intersecting, and problems of both groups should be solved.

It's not a dichotomy. You can't say let's solve problems of the poor instead of BAME and maybe BAME would feel better in the process. You have two work with both.",-0.9871

I do call white poor kids discriminated against.  They are discriminated against by a system which tends to ignore poverty ... I mean, look at the number of years of Tory (and Tory ish) rule.  

My sense is that of the problems, it's 90pc class, 10pc race.  Looking at crime, where there are race significance it is still small differences that wouldn't really change headline numbers if removed.  That should not stop them from being removed.  But we would still be having all these conversations if the courts were colourblind, because I'm not aware of anyone saying that a disproportionate amount of crime isn't being committed by BAME.",-0.914
