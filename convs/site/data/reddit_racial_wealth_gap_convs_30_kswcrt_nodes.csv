This is literally a white supremacist dog whistle. Black people were denied property rights for hundreds of years - most cities of the US that have either an ""East"" or ""West"" that is a separate city is because black people weren't allowed to purchase property in the main city. That's what ""redlining"" is. Predominantly black schools, which are in predominantly black areas, are much less likely to be well funded than schools of any other racial makeup.  Black people have also been historically denied loans more often, been historically denied jobs more often, been preventing from middle class opportunities more often - look up how many black WW2 veterans were denied their promised benefits of the GI Bill - and prevented from higher education more often. Even today, when black people have a much higher likelihood of getting into college than ever before, they *still* have much lower rates of college acceptance than white people. If there are two identical people, one black and one white, who get arrested for marijuana possession, the black person on average gets a sentence 8 years longer than the white person. To say we're ""focused on race"" is completely asinine. We can find proven links between all these things and to deny that is to pretend like these problems don't exist - just like what you're doing.",-0.3535

But I do feel like there is something to be said about the *general* lack of property ownership in urban centers, which are known to be predominantly black and Hispanic. When you consider the fact that *very few* people in urban centers actually own their primary residence, and very few who live in large cities like NY actually bother with car ownership, it skews this data quite a bit.

Yes, there is a disparity of ownership within those urban centers. The few people who own their primary residence are likely to be white for a variety of reasons probably tying back to institutional racism. However, the difference on home ownership and car ownership here is likely related to the disproportionate number of black and Hispanic people living in urban centers where car and home ownership aren't required.

The reason urban centers are largely populated by minorities is worthy of discussion. But it should be acknowledged that this skews this data in a way that is not representative of the conclusions people tend to draw from this kind of data.",0.1768

They do choose that lifestyle. When you get down to it communities have a lot of choices. Their can collect taxes and spend money on whatever is important to them.

And the tax thing is the main issue, the problem is it's hard to get taxes from people who don't have a lot to begin with. Thank you for agreeing we need more taxes and increase school's funding, unfortunately that doesn't happen. A lot of funding comes from local taxes, and if the area is impoverished, you can imagine there's not going to be a lot of tax income

Being black has nothing to do with it. Plenty of towns choose to have weak institutions in order to avoid paying taxes. Plenty of towns have enough money to properly address their problems but don't hold their politicians accountable when the politicians steal the money. 

&gt; And the tax thing is the main issue, the problem is it's hard to get taxes from people who don't have a lot to begin with. 

It shouldn't be hard if the people want good services. The issue is that they don't want them, not enough to pay for them. That's part of the poverty trap right? Spending too much on low quality products and services because they are cheap. 

It's not like getting a community up and running is rocket science.

The key is to get responsible people elected, but that doesn't seem to be something poorer communities are interested in to their own detriment.",-0.9517
