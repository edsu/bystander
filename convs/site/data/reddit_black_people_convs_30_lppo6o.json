If you asked anyone if black managers were under represented in England they'd probably tell you that they are but is it really true?\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52979173\n\nThis article would certainly give you the idea that it is.\n\nSix black (or non white) managers out of 92 in the English professional game. That's 6.5%.\n\nThe article then goes on to talk about how 14% of the country is *BAME* to try and say that they're under represented. The thing is that a majority of those are Asian and aren't really involved in football at *any* level and meanwhile black players are *vastly* over represented in the PL but no one talks about *that* racial imbalance.\n\nSo compared to the general population black head coaches in England are actually slightly *over represented*. I doubt many people knew that.\n\nMeanwhile \"The FA has set a target for 20% of the England team's coaching staff to be from a BAME background by the end of 2021\".\n\nHow on earth do you justify that? BAME people do *not* make up 20% of the population.\n\nAnd, from the same article, you get \"Levi Desouza, a volunteer coach at Leicester Nirvana, says he's struggled to get jobs higher up the coaching ladder - and he can't understand why. \"I'm not trying to pull a race card or anything, but I've applied to clubs around Leicester. It's questionable why it's been overlooked\".\"\n\nIt's as if the guy doesn't realise that getting a professional coaching gig is *really* difficult and competetive but it must just be racism because he doesn't have one.",

I admit that my previous statement is not 100% correct.\n\nIn hindsight, maybe I shouldn't use so little words to discuss a serious subject to convey my point to begin with.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo clarify my point: \n\nThere is no doubt that there is inequalities of opportunities based on race, the observation shouldn't based on looking at the current representation of POC coaches. Because we are not solving for equality in outcome, otherwise it will be similiar to saying we need to employ 1 POC trainer for every white trainer we employ elsewhere. \n\nWhat we need to do is to increase the opportunities given to BAME players who wish to transtition into coaching after their playing career has ended, and improve their employment prospect, as demonstrated in your source. So in the near future, employers (clubs) have a more racially diversed talent pool to hire from.\n\nHowever, Seedorf's current situation sits above that, he already is a qualified trainer/coach. If he were to complain and said he wasn't given opportunities because he is black and justified it by saying there's no POC coach in \"top 5 leagues\" or football in general, that is something I just disagree. Because then in my opinion, he is no longer trying to compete the same position based on competency, but racial differences. Looking at the list of available coaches [here](https://www.transfermarkt.com/trainer/verfuegbaretrainer/statistik), I would struggle to justify between hiring Sarri (for example) and hiring Seedorf if we cast financials aside.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on that?",

Once you work out how many BAME players are British or plan to take their badges in the UK, you can then put together percentages to show if they are underrepresented or not. \n\nI know Henry and Vieria took their badges with the Welsh FA in 2016 (IIRC), so back then you could look at those two as potential BAME candidates who are in the UK looking for work, what good is looking at a black European player who has been in the UK for half a season? That just inflates the statistics \n\nI also think another factor is that a lot of managers nowadays finished playing in the last 20/30 years, how many black players were playing back then? Was there encouragement for them to get into coaching or not?

He's saying those two things separately. He's saying that it is a difficult job that requires a bunch of pre-work to be done to even be eligible. He's also saying that black people aren't doing that pre-work (no idea if that is true, but for argument's sake let's assume that black players don't get their coaching badges at the same rate as other players). He is saying that you can't claim that it is racism in the clubs not appointing black players as managers when there are so many fewer eligible former black players, because they aren't doing their badges. You speculated that these players are choosing not to do their badges because they perceive racism in the heirarchy, and he's saying that this is shit reasoning, because not even making yourself eligible to get the job means you are the reason that the job isn't going to you, not racism.\n\nAgain, I don't know what the actual numbers are. I don't have an opinion on whether it is racism or not that is holding back black managers. I don't know whether racism is what causes black people to be so massively over-represented in the Premier League as players either. It isn't at all obvious and throwing up stats like '20% of players are non-white, so 3% of managers being non-white is racism' is at best misleading and more likely disingenuous.",

Maybe having so few black coaches to look up to dissuades retired black players from pursuing coaching?).\n\nUntil that research is carried out though you have to admit that near 20% of footballers in the UK being black and only 6.5% of football managers being BAME looks suspect.

'why is the player pool so heavily skewed towards certain races but not others?' 'why is the management pool skewed differently to the player pool?' 'what proportion of pro players end up choosing to earn their badges to become eligible to manage clubs?' 'how is this different between different types of players?'

When in attack, Barnes' sides attempt to get the ball to the line at a variety of speeds ranging from slow to fast. In team talks Barnes always warns his players to be wary of the opposition's attempts to hit them and hurt them in both defence and attack. One criticism levelled at sides managed by Barnes is that one way they beat their opposition is as a result of getting around the back. John Barnes, although born in Jamaica, is a self proclaimed England man, and he refers to his tactical strategy as \"the masterplan\". Barnes is noted for his opposition to both hooliganism and football songs, and also for his firm belief that, with the crest of the club on their chests, his players cannot go wrong.\n\nwtf",

And they often say that defender tend to be great coach but two of the GREATEST  defenders of the history of the game where denied this right because they are black.\n\nAnd when you finally have a chance, it always on tough spot like Henry with Monaco, Seedorf with Milan or Makelele with Bastia.\n\nAnd if you fail, which was pretty much expected with such scenarios, then you will never have another chance in a top league. Like Makelele you will go to a little club in Belgium or like Henry in Canada to coach a MLS team.\n\nThe second scenario is to start very low like Vieira who played all his career in England and Italy and go to the US and then wait a chance to Europe.  Thanks to his connections with Manchester City otherwise like many others, he wouldn't even have a chance to coach a professonal club while being arguably the greatest box to box player in the history of the game...what a joke.\n\nNice finally gave him his chance but he was tricked. While Puel and Favre had great teams with players like Pereira, Plea, Ben Arfa, Belhanda,  Cyprien ( rated as good as Rabiot and Ndombele in France before the ACL ), Seri that played like Xavi, Dante which had something to prove after leaving Germany, Balotelli which played great to show that he was still good...\n\nVieira had a Nice team that sold all their good players + the owner sold the team with only left Dante which started to be very old, a damaged Cyprien and Balotelli frustrated to be so good under Favre but with no teams interested to sign during the summer so he first tried to go on a strike and finally came back in september in a bad shape. But the medias and the fans still expected to see Nice performs like they did with Puel last season and Favre 2 seasons...forgetting that Nice was always an average Ligue 1 team exept those 3 years where the scooting was great.\n\nWhile when a white great player want to coach, it's not rare to see that he'll quickly find a TOP CLUB to coach like Guardiola, Zidane ( I know his origins is from Algeria but he can pass as white not like Benzema for example) or even worst Lampard or Arteta which didn't even coach the youth team 1 or 2 years before take over the top spot.\n\nGood to average wiith players will also find a first or second division club of their country. And if they fail, they will have second or third chance before being ignored.\n\nEven average players or amateur level players will have chances.\n\nIt's unfair but that's the narrative.",

I think a lot stems from how black players are seen and scouted. When is the last time you heard someone in the media describe a black player as intelligent? Black players are always praised for the physical attributes but much less so for their brain. This is common in sports like American football as well. Because of this, I\u2019d imagine it becomes harder for black players to transition to coaches. Players like Pirlo and Xavi have easily found work because they have always been consider intelligent players. But I imagine someone like Pogba will struggle to become a coach if he has those aspirations, because he always been considered a much more physical player, despite playing the same position as Pirlo and Xavi.",

Where are the minority versions of them? He is comparable to Rooney, Lampard, Gerrard etc. Club legends given a chance.

Maybe those making the decisions at the less visible levels are more likely to be racially biased.

You either prove that racism is the main contributing factor, or disprove all the other potential reasons. \n\nAgreed. The subject is complex and complex subjects have a myriad of contributing factors so it's important to weight how much \"systemic racism\" is contributing. This would be where you actually show some objective proof like I did rather than subjective reasoning but you don't have any because...\n\nI'm not saying systemic racism is the evil white man keeping minorities down. It's usually a case of unconcious bias, we like people like us so the interviewer might just relate to the white candidates more which forms barriers for minorities who may be just as good, worse or better than candidates with this advantage. \n\nJust keep in mind that I could be wrong and you could be wrong but someone who has actually experienced the whole process in Seedorf and a bunch of other black managers have said they think this is happening so who would you believe?",

However Seedorf can only speak for himself, as those other managers can only do the same. I assume that black managers who don't feel they've experienced racism in their time coaching cannot wash over other experiecnes either with \"well it hasn't happened to me\". \n\nAll in all this needs an independant investigation, looking at not only one statistic but case by case scenarios and all possible statistics.\n\nAlthough I doubt that football will ever investigate itself for racism, it will just take a knee to point the blame elsewhere.",
