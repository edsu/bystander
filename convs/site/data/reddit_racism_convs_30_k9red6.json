At first, the elite class arrived as political refugees and supporters of the U.S.-backed regime that Castro\u2019s revolution had ousted. The flows then grew to include middle- and lower-class Cubans as the revolution radicalized.\u201d\n\n\n- https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/cuban-immigrants-united-states-2018\n\n\n\u201cCuban immigration to the United States can be described as having four distinct waves. The first, from 1959-62, began with the departure of Cubans following the rise of Fidel Castro. The initial exodus primarily consisted of upper and uppermiddle class families in professional and managerial occupations. The second wave, from about 1965 to 1974, featured orderly departure programs administered by the U.S and Cuban governments. The so-called \u201cfreedom flights\u201d brought middle and working class Cubans to the United States.\u201d\n\n- https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2006/08/25/cubans-in-the-united-states/",
