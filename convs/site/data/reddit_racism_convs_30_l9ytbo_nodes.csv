It was a mostly black school and this was before No Child Left Behind so we spent the whole month in social studies, English and history learning uncensored US history with a focus on black literature and art. It was a month long black American cultural festival and it felt like it had a significant impact on me and a lot of the other kids.

Difference was, this program came from a principal who was very serious about preparing young black people for the world they were to enter and the history that followed them. This is likely about using the legacy of black American historical figures to hock some shit with Bluetooth in it.",0.6705

What strikes me as strange is that it's acceptable (or even expected) for a corporation, a university, or even a Twitter/Instagram influencer  to publicly celebrate BHM. But I'm guessing that if a white person approached a black neighbor or coworker and sincerely said ""Happy Black History Month!"" it would come off as impersonal, disconnected, condescending.
