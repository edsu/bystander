So, first things first: vote. Encourage everyone you know to vote.

But that still leaves two groups of people: decent white people and minorities.

I'm 60, white, grew up in Alabama. I vote Democrat, always have. 

It's not that a majority of people are racist assholes, it's that the racist assholes all vote, and not enough good people vote. Half of Americans don't bother, typically. More than half of Americans stay home for mid-term elections, and almost nobody turns out for primaries, by-elections, et cetera.

The problem isn't racism, it's apathy.

In addition to previous voter suppression efforts and new ones that have been added by the sycophant trump supporters we are heading on the road to authoritarianism.  If trump wasn't so damn stupid and just shut his damn mouth he probably could have gotten another term and we would have really been screwed.
