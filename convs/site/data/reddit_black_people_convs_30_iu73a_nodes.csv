My meaning is that many people disagree with how the riots are going about, and from what I see in Portland the issue is outside groups using these protests to cause chaos while having nothing to do with blm. Of course even without Antifa our government has been known to use an agent provocateur to turn peaceful protests violent so they can bring in police.",-0.9607

Though if it was something like ""*The* blacks"" that seems more suspicious to me.

Also they clearly have some prejudice going on there so maybe they do mean it in a harmful way. Just be aware that's not always such a red flag.",0.1949

To use it as an adjective is not problematic (e.g. black lives matter, black individuals, the black community, etc.) but once it is not an adjective but rather a collective noun that’s when it becomes problematic.",-0.6245
