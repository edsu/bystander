Specifically, they want to be able to choke BIPOC as they rape them. There is a reason they can stand arm in arm with Nazis/Klansmen.

It's because they want that. To Trump supporters, Amon Goeth is the hero of Schindlers List. Leo is the hero of Django Unchained.

They're not fearful of oppression. They're hopeful for it. A future where they can own, rape, and sell a human being? That's a Trump supporter dream.",0.2796
