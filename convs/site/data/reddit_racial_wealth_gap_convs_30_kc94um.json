Their conclusion is that an annual wealth tax is not feasible, but a suprise one-off wealth tax would work (which means the clock starts now, as people can be prepared...). \n\nIt isn't actually that difficult to value property. They already value it for estate tax in the US, why should it be any different for a wealth tax? The property has the same value regardless of the name of the tax. \n\nThe difficulty is that it is easy to avoid the tax if the parameters are known, making it more ineffective (hence why one-off works, annual doesn't). The administration would be very cumbersome -for instance valuing an estate can take multiple years already, an annual wealth tax significantly mutiplies the amount of property needed to be valued.",

Top marginal tax rates in the 1950s approached 90%.  What's happened since then, and especially since the late 1970s, is federal taxes were decreased so much that much of the revenue we used to build our infrastructure remained with top income earners instead of being pumped back into the economy and funding social and educational programs.

Food stamp, welfare, unemployment, disability payments are exempt.  We are not assholes.  We help our poor.\n5. No tax shelters.\n6. If the money is earned by a US company, taxes are owed to the US, regardless if the income came from abroad or not.

If you can point to a policy today that systematically denies equal access to something for people based on race, then I'll oppose that with you.\n\nHowever, seeking to proactively modify the distribution of wealth in order to achieve a specific outcome by race, is, uh, not that.\n\nThe unfortunate bit about the truly liberal approach to correcting the racial injustice of the past is that - if implemented correctly - it will take a few generations for random chance alone to 'mix' populations from initial conditions where they are by some measure 'separate'.  Going the other way - committing what are effectively mild racial injustices (e.g. affirmative action policy) - is said to speed up that process but at the cost of completely discarding the principle \"equality under the law\".  The other issue is that it's hard to identify an endpoint for those policies -- they will always seek to change the distribution of wealth/opportunity/success so long as the world falls short of a hypothetical ideal (e.g. exactly zero mutual information between race and some set of outcomes).  Further what if there's a third, hidden variable, which causes disparate outcomes correlated with race?\n\nThere should never be a policy or law that permits different treatment by race.",

It's not in the law books as blatly as it was, but it lingers in the racial wealth gap.\n\nIf it's not on the books then it is not in the system.\n\n\n&gt;For centeries, black people where denied equal access to the tools of wealth creation, this has resulted in the racial wealth gap.\n\nYes, and if they are poor, we help them, the same way we help poor asians or poor Hispanics or poor whites.\n\n&gt;By not addressing it, we allow the echos of white Supremacy to continue.\n\nWe addressed it already.  It's not on the books anymore.  In your world, will my half asian children become the heirs to white supremacy?\n&gt;\n&gt;I'm well ost certain that if your ancestors where here I. The 30s - 50s they benefited on the massive investment the government had in white America. \n\nMy grandparents did not benefit as much as you think, my grandfather was a soldier in WW2, and worked the rest of his life in a factory. And my other grandfather, well he was 1/2 native american, so....\n\n&gt;How come your ancestors got help to build wealth, but we cant do the same to people still suffering from the echoes of racism through economis??\n\nWhatever the case is for the past, today's people have the opportunity to build regardless of race.

The US doesn't have that. You guys still pay a ton to survive (healthcare, in form of insurance), life saving's worth for education (which makes you eligible for escaping poverty trap, for the most part), you don't have a strong enough safety net for crises that could happen and have people unemployed for no fault of their own, or safety nets for housing and rent which leaves people homeless. You guys need to worry about those before arguing whether the receiver of those will just opt out of being productive because they receive basic human rights. \n\nAlso, just so you know, \"the rich\" here are ones that have abused the capitalist system, went through loopholes to avoid taxes, and exploited people not having access to those basic human rights, in order to inflate their own wealth.

Unfortunately you\u2019re wrong. The system isn\u2019t working for most people.\n\nHousing is expensive for reasons that have little or nothing to do with Mr. Bezos.  Specifically governments making it almost impossible to build new housing in places where people want it combined with artificially low interest rates (which admittedly are also correlated with some of the wealth bubble we are seeing).\n\nWhat's your reason why they can't afford homes?

      "text": "&gt;So the idea is that if the big bad rich people leave, some other rich people will come and do a better job because... reasons?\n\nNope. I was just suggesting one of the many solutions to the 'oh no, the rich guy left!' issue. Its what my hometown did when the owner of the factory closed up shop and left. The town bought the factory and continued to produce the same products under a new name, since all the machines were left behind for sale when the owners left.\n\n&gt;Either way the point is that it won\u2019t redistribute anything because others will just come and take over.\n\nThis is a *very very* fair concern. Pretty much all of what you said are fair things to plan for. If we raise tax on the rich folk and they leave, then have the communities they abandon run the abandoned businesses, we would certainly need to have some kind of check/balance on this system to prevent the same old issue from arising. \n\n&gt;Instead of [...] why not [...] ?\n\nWell, Im not proposing we kick out the rich folk. Id like people to pay a bigger share when they use more public resources such as in their cases, but wont cry if they decide to leave rather than pay whats fair. I dont think Higher Taxation for more use is 'taking money from those who are already successful' either, as their success would not be possible without the public supporting them in hundreds of ways. \n\nThat being said, I agree that \"Increasing minimum wage, making education free etc.\" are cornerstone parts of a good, healthy society. I think you and I probably agree on most issues surrounding these things. I only bring up the things I am because my lived experience has shown me real alternatives.

      "text": "Yeah, I think a substantial portion of the racial wealth gap is attributable to both historical and current forms of discrimination preventing black Americans from accumulating wealth or the means to earn high incomes:\n\n* Private discrimination preventing ownership of homes, depressing property values in black neighborhoods, preventing equal access to business credit for building profitable businesses, preventing black-owned businesses from having the same level of success, systematically lower pay, access to training/mentorship/apprenticeships, etc.\n* Government discrimination preventing access to similar quality education at either the K-12 level or university/professional educations, reducing access to credit or insurance for homeownership, enforcing Jim Crow, redlining neighborhoods to effectively endorse private economic discrimination, etc.\n\nMeanwhile, a shift towards a winner-take-all economy (weakening not only labor's bargaining power against management/ownership, but also small businesses against big businesses, local businesses versus national/global players, even small investors versus big investors), has baked in past economic winners into consolidation of wealth and power, so that the unequal starting position is perpetuated, and even intensified over the past few decades.\n\nSo the solution might be to give labor and smaller investors and smaller businesses a fighting chance, in a competitive environment where a thumb on the scale in favor of the smaller players is effectively a drag on the bigger players. The big problem, though, is that proposals designed to even the playing field (e.g., reducing the regressive economic drag of high prices in healthcare, housing, and education) are often met with hand-wringing about how we're gonna pay for all of this. So taxation has to be part of the equation, and progressive taxation is the most economically efficient way to meet particular revenue targets.\n\nIt's all interconnected (race-conscious social/economic/political forces and race-neutral forces, private social/economic forces and public policy, distribution of wealth, racial justice, taxation of wealth, etc.). And comprehensive solutions need to recognize how things are connected, rather than tying one hand behind the back and trying to focus on the best one-handed solution.",

      "text": "It\u2019s hilarious to you because you see wealth as a zero sum game. Most of that wealth is potential wealth \u2014 the value that is currently placed in the shares of the companies they own, not money in the bank or physical assets. Play out the scenario where the rich must sell off 10% of their assets each year to pay the tax. So 10% of he shares go on the market. First of all that will drive down share value, making \u201cwealth\u201d vanish without benefiting anyone. Second, someone has to buy those shares, which diverts investments from other potential uses, resulting in a net drop of investment in corporations, which like results in a drop in productivity and stagnation of wages. Every single year. Then, what does the Government do with these taxes? They could put it into social security building retirement wealth, but that\u2019s a non-transferable wealth that won\u2019t necessarily benefit the next generation. You could just give cash benefits but that will likely be spent,  not kept as wealth. The Government could instead by shares and give them to citizens, but will they keep them or turn around and sell them, again not increasing wealth. \n\nAnd all this will be controlled by a government which has a poor record in such regards. Take social security for instance \u2014 how much better would the trust fund be if it had been professionally managed instead of going to the general funds and getting meager returns since its inception.

Whether that is for a wealth tax or a capital gains tax is in my view almost irrelevant. If a taxpayer can find 1.7% of his wealth annually to pay for their tax bill, they can also find 30% or so of their capital gains on average.\n\nAs for revenue, it's about 0,65% of GDP. So in US terms, it would be arounud 130bn a year. So that is not enough to address the wealth gap in a single year, but if you keep it up for a long period of time, I would be surprised if it didn't have an impact. Maybe not to close it really, but it would surely help to avoid it growing so fast?",

This means investors must pay tax not only on the real return but also on the inflation created by the Federal Reserve.\n\nNot sure why this is relevant.\n\n&gt; Finally, a capital gains tax, like nearly all of the federal tax code, is a tax on future consumption. Future personal consumption, in the form of savings, is taxed, while present consumption is not. By favoring present over future consumption, savings are discouraged, which decreases future available capital and lowers long term growth.\n\nI do pay income taxes on current consumption so that's completely nonsense, people with the propensity to save won't decide to buy 87 cars because they don't want to pay taxes.\n\nI'm happy the Cato thinks it's a good idea with their generally anti-tax stances.",

Bush pushed the idea of the government driving home ownership, or the ownership society as he called it, specifically to give poorer people a shot at home ownership. \n\nLike all such programs, the motivations were good, the implementation and results were disastrous for the entire economy, especially for the many families that refinanced their homes for some quick cash. \n\nTo his credit, the Bush administration did warn congress that the loan criteria for Fannie Mae loans were too loose and would cause a foreclosure backlash, but they never imagined the extent.\n\nThe unforeseen consequences of a program designed to help people were mind boggling.

      "text": "&gt;Not sure why this is relevant.\n\nThe time factor in investment results in significant changes to effective capital gains tax rates. Let me do a bit of napkin math here to illustrate. Suppose you have a $10k investment that makes 5% returns in a 2% inflation environment, and you hold that investment for 10 years. It's now worth $16288, and your real return is $4099. However, your income for the purpose of capital gains taxation is $6288. As a result, a 20% nominal capital gains tax would be a 30.6% real capital gains tax on this particular investment.\n\nTaxes on ordinary income don't have this problem, because taxes are collected in the same year. There is technically some inflation between paycheck day and tax day, but it's de minimis.\n\n&gt;I do pay income taxes on current consumption so that's completely nonsense\n\nYou don't pay income taxes on current consumption. Whether you consume more or less is irrelevant to your income tax exposure.\n\n&gt;I'm happy the Cato thinks it's a good idea with their generally anti-tax stances.\n\nI find the linked piece is coherent, i.e. they have presented an internally consistent argument.

They're directly related, because giving the people at the bottom or the middle sufficient bargaining power to be able to hold their own against their richest and most powerful competitors means inherently limiting the (relative) power of the people already at the top.\n\nThat mechanism is race-neutral on its face, but because the disparate impact of the status quo disproportionately limits the ability of the poor and middle class to become rich, targeting that mechanism will have the effect of reversing some of that disparate impact (thereby becoming a disparate impact the other way).",

Take a few minutes to actually read it.\n\nAccording to Table 1, before government assistance:\n* 14.1 million working-age adult whites in poverty (24.3%)\n* 6.5 million working-age adult blacks in poverty (43.1%)\n* 8.6 million working-age adult Hispanics in poverty (36.2%)\n\nAnd after government assistance:\n* 7.9 million working-age adult whites in poverty (13.6%)\n* 2.8 million working-age adult blacks in poverty (24.4%)\n* 6.3 million working-age adult Hispanics in poverty (26.2%)\n\nIn terms of impact (percent lifted above the poverty line):\n* 44% of whites\n* 43% of blacks\n* 28% improvement for Hispanics\n\nAlmost exactly equal for whites and blacks. So, yes, that \"[does work] out really well\". (Not for Hispanics, though, according to this study. That needs to be investigated and understood.)",

Most if not all of those reforms require higher taxes especially at the top end and increased government intervention (e.g. social democracy)  at the national, state and local levels. This includes but not limited to better funded primary and secondary education, UBI, universal health care, paid parental leave(available to be split between both parents), **END TO BAILING OUT FAILED CORPORATIONS** etc. That is how Scandinavian countries have been able to create wealth and increase equality across all their inhabitants, citizens and immigrants alike. I literally wrote an 5 page paper on this the other day so some arguments are pretty fresh in my head. There's some limits to how fast and how far we can adapt these programs because Americans are still taught to believe that social problems are individual problems and the \"rugged individual\" at least to some extent.\n\nThere is still the argument that the US is too big but that and other common (legitimate) arguments against a system more like Nordic countries can be shut down fairly easily by the fact that we had many of these programs during the great depression and some are still around. Medicare, Medicaid, socialized medicine for government officials and military still exists and are very popular.  Using our size and diversity as an excuse is a lazy cop-out especially since we won't even try. \n\nSource of analysis on the Nordic model: Viking Economics by George Lakey.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTL;DR it's a multi prong problem requiring a multi prong approach that mainly involves increased taxation on the high end, more government intervention and an end to corporate socialism.",

Suppose you have a $10k investment that makes 5% returns in a 2% inflation environment, and you hold that investment for 10 years. It's now worth $16288, and your real return is $4099. However, your income for the purpose of capital gains taxation is $6288. As a result, a 20% nominal capital gains tax would be a 30.6% real capital gains tax on this particular investment.\n\nTaxes on ordinary income don't have this problem, because taxes are collected in the same year. There is technically some inflation between paycheck day and tax day, but it's de minimis.\n\nI understand all that but I'm not sure TVM should be a huge consideration from a tax perspective.\n\n&gt; You don't pay income taxes on current consumption. Whether you consume more or less is irrelevant to your income tax exposure.\n\nIncome taxes still exist. Am I missing something here? As i earn my salary uncle sam gets his cut dollar for dollar. On top of sales taxes? Are you saying this because all income dollars will be taxed independent of whether or not they are invested (excluding 401k)\n\n&gt;I find the linked piece is coherent, i.e. they have presented an internally consistent argument.

Ya know what they did to fix it? Taxed the rich. Taxed the hell out of em. That pushed us into decades of prosperity. People didn't care about politics because they were comfortable. Bad legislation was passed over and over again. Favoring corporations, and hurting the working class. We are facing an economic crisis, and you want to say that we live better than nobles  hundreds of years ago? Puhlease!   Of course we do! Get out of here with that argument. It has no relevance whatsoever. WHERE DO YOU ALLOCATE FUNDS FROM TO BRING THE POOR PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY TO AN ACCEPTABLE STANDARD OF LIVING? keep in mind that raising the minimum wage is an expense burdened by the rich. Or do you just think that we should give up, say, \"at least I'm doing better than some rich tart that died a couple hundred years ago?\" It is either tax driven, or money is printed.

I don't really want to do the math on all of this, but accounting for charitable contributions only (ignoring the fact that he still got taxed on some of it) takes the marginal rate up to 18.5%.\n\nYou might think double taxation is zombie accounting but take a minute and ask yourself if the person who pays the cigarette tax changes if the tax is calculated at the register and paid by the consumer or if the tax is paid for by the seller and added to the sticker price.  In the same way, when a company pays a dividend to a person they pay tax on that money as ordinary income (in 2011, a 39% rate) and then that pile of cash is taxed a *second* time when it changes hands.  Of course, who really walks home at the end of the day with less money depends on elasticities, but if anything that highlights the major problem with corporate income taxes - the incidence is highly variable and non-transparent (you could claim that the 39% income tax paid on the dividend came out of the paycheck of janitors just as easily as someone else can claim it reduced the size of dividends).\n\n&gt; As for the \"optimal\" capital gains?

Just society can exist without equity of outcomes. \n\nIf you force everyone back to stone age to live in caves, you will have perfect equity, but other than satisfying your eat-the-rich boner, it doesn\u2019t make anyone better off. \n\nPractically speaking, too much inqueality is bad, because it leads to market inefficiencies and some social unrest, but if you can control for both, inequality is absolutely a neutral concept and there is nothing inherently bad about some people being unimaginably rich. The goal should be creating most prosperous society, which is a different approach than animalistic gut feeling of jealousy of somebody else having more. \n\n&gt;\tPercentages don\u2019t matter\n\nPercentages is just an efficient and fair approach to raise taxes, but if flat tax could generate same funds with no negative externalities, it would work just as well. \n\nWhat matters is how much money you are raising and who\u2019s paying it. The various small prints of how exactly those taxes are generated is just details. \n\nAt high level, we, as a society, are extracting nearly all our taxes *exclusively* from the rich, with bottom 90% of citizens and 100% corporations paying a nearly insignificant amount. And you\u2019re arguing here, they should pay even more yet, when they already pay for nearly all of it. Okay, I don\u2019t object to raising taxes, but there should be a better reason why it\u2019s needed than your personal hate for those better off than you. \n\nWhen Trump CUT taxes, it INCREAED overall tax revenue, for example. So, raising taxes just to do it is really stupid. The goal should be to RAISE MONEY, not to punish the rich.",
