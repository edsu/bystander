Or would it be his abject failure to grasp and control the narrative, thereby ceding it to the Tories and likely gifting them another generation in power? Or is it his focus on changing party rules, issuing authoritarian diktats, expelling members, and pursuing legal action against the left wing members of the Party? Is it his normalisation of transphobia or his selective, racist, and dehumanising politicisation of anti-semitism? Perhaps it's Mr Abstain's total failure to actually *oppose* that you like? \n\nMaybe it's his total inability to actually get ahead of the Tories - or even match Corbyn's polling numbers -, despite having an unprecedentedly sycophantic media and the Tories having a buffoon in charge during a pandemic that they've world-leadingly bungled, while also pursing one of the most significant constitutional changes in British history, under brexit, that (again) they've managed to completely cock up, and after a decade of their austerity measures that have crippled the economy.\n\nEach to their own.
