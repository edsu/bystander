My current neighborhood literally has one white person living here. None of us, none of my family, none of my neighbors have been hunted by the police. We\u2019ve met racist cops, but we\u2019ve met far more fair and minority cops than racist or even white. I\u2019ve also dealt with racist teachers, coworkers, and store clerks... none of them have \u201chunted\u201d me or any black people I know... and I\u2019ve met far more kind and open-minded people than racist people in this country. \n\nI guess they only hunt black people where you live.",
