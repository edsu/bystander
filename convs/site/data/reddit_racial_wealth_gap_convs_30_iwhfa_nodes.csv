The average black family's wealth was 13.9% of the  average  white family in 1963.  In 2016 is was 15.2%.  For the median it went from 5.2% of the average white family in 1963 to 10.2% in 2016.  The data is for whites vs nonwhites in the 1963 case, but breaking out black families should be similar.   

Put another way, the median family wealth of white family increased by around 359% between 1963 and 2016.  For the median black family, it increased by 706%.

There is still a big disparity, but the trend is toward a smaller disparity.  What's shown in section 4 of the link supports that also, since younger people have a much smaller racial wealth than older people.",0.9528

That includes massive stratification within the experience of white folks.

Poverty &amp; hardship are not exclusive to any race or demographic.

However, when you're looking at the average wealth of the black population as SO MUCH lower than the average wealth of the white population AND there are systemic reasons that have contributed to that (see slavery, segregation, Jim crow laws, redlining) it is worth talking about black poverty as something that, only in the big picture, demands more attention than white poverty.

I'm not going to educate you on every reason why it is worth discussing systemic inequity as a separate conversation than individual inequity, but I'll give you a little teaser:

www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/redlining-what-is-history-mike-bloomberg-comments/

&gt;As a result, banks and other mortgage lenders commonly rejected loans for creditworthy borrowers based strictly on their race or where they lived. As part of that practice, financial firms, real estate agents and other parties demarcated geographic areas that were effectively off limits for issuing loans. 


Creditworthy families of color (and families who lived or wanted to live in the ""wrong areas"" were consistently denied loans to purchase residential property, which is a significant part of how generational wealth &amp; opportunity is built (via appreciation in value, lower housing costs allowing for sending children to better schools, more stable housing &amp; communities leading to better job opportunities and more fiscal resilience)

These practices were legal &amp; commonplace and created that gap. Removing the barrier does not create equity when one population has a 40 year head start",0.9831
