And tbh that kind of shit can even be funny sometimes when it’s not constantly making fun of just one group. I’ve mellowed out to jokes involving my people since and I’m glad I did. I’ve heard some great jokes and by not being confrontational, I have helped inform the more ignorant types. A few years back a party I used to roll with kicked out a dude because when he drank he would get really angry and yell and say slurs with real anger in his voice. A joke on occasion is one thing, but when you start yelling the nword at a players, there’s not any real defense for being that.",0.4117

Of course they’re going to turn on you.",0.4678
