A community is comprised of its members, not hectares of land. You are describing essentially an increase in land and property value. That does not benefit the residents of poorer communities which are already disproportionately more likely to be renters. It benefits property speculators, generally individuals and pension funds that are not members of the communities. \n\nFourth, you seem to think that gentrification just stops at some reasonable point where it's *just* desegregated enough, rather than continuing to drive working class people of all ethnicities out of the area, generally into increasingly underserviced and socioeconomically deprived geographic areas. \n\nIt's hardly an era defining economic treatise, but How To Kill a City is an interesting beginner's level description of what gentrification is, how it works, and who it benefits.

Over ten years, we would expect about 60 percent of less  educated renters to move out of non-gentrifying low income  neighborhoods, compared to about 66 percent of less educated renters in  gentrifying neighborhoods.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Those who leave gentrifying neighborhoods do not end up moving to  destination neighborhoods that are measurably worse than the destination  neighborhoods of households moving out of poor but not gentrifying  neighborhoods  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**The demographic composition of gentrifying neighborhoods,  post-gentrification, remains highly mixed, with many less educated  renters and homeowners**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Less educated renters that remain in gentrifying neighborhood don\u2019t  see significant increases in rents:**\u00a0 There\u2019s no appreciable difference  in rent increases between less educated living in gentrifying and  non-gentrifying neighborhoods  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Demographic changes in gentrifying neighborhoods are those that are  generally associated with better outcomes for low income children**  growing up in these neighborhoods.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**Poor neighborhoods that don\u2019t gentrify, don\u2019t state the same, they  decline:\u00a0 non-gentrifying neighborhoods lose population and experience  declining incomes.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Many existing studies of gentrifying neighborhoods that don\u2019t  account for high levels of migration even in non-gentrifying  neighborhoods, that don\u2019t disaggregate effects by socioeconomic status,  and that rely primarily on median rent statistics can produce misleading  pictures of neighborhood change.",

      "text": "Don't conflate the American Socialist's inability to obtain the majority requisite for governing, and their ability to influence policy.\n\nIt is, the same political party in the States that fought for slavery, implemented the policies leading to redlining, and now fights to stop the redevelopment of predominately black communities.\n\nRedlining promptly resulted in disruption of normal neighborhood life-cycles and prevented development in these poorer communities.\n\nI'm not stating that gentrification and desegregation are the same process, but that in America, poverty trends can be traced along racial lines; There is an overwhelming relationship between poverty and race in the US.\n\nWith the affect redlining had on neighborhood development, those neighborhoods account for a vast % of impoverished blacks in America -- and score worst on the diversity index -- they are segregated communities. For these communities, in America, gentrification *is* a question of desegregation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*\\[...\\] it also frequently kills some cultural traditions and diversity, the precise characteristics that make cities so dynamic and desirable in the first place.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Gentrification may provide a new tax base, but it also reshapes what   cities are, turning them into explicit supporters of inequality, reliant   on it to self-fund, yet still unable to meet the needs of their poor.*\n\nNotice a key tenet Merkowitz's argument: killing cultural traditions and diversity, reshaping the cities...\n\nThese neighborhoods are NOT diverse, they have some of the worst diversity index scores; He simply means it ceases to be a black enclave -- too many white people.\n\nYou assert that gentrification drives out the old residents of a neighborhood -- same argument in a sense, but not focused on race. You also assert it drives up rent costs (which you deem to be a major factor in driving people out).\n\nFor your fears on gentrification:\n\n[https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2019/wp19-30.pdf](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2019/wp19-30.pdf)\n\nRent increases for gentrifying neighborhoods increase at a slower rate than non gentrifying. Further, an NYU study also corroborates: \"Gentrification\" of an area doesn't drive residents out of their neighborhoods any faster than what happens in non-gentrifying neighborhoods.\n\nIn reality, the oppositions you and Merkowitz levy aren't based in fact.\n\n&gt;I think you're exhibiting a combination of naivete and magical thinking  that is typical of ideologues and particularly of those of libertarian  stripes, which is not amenable to scientific thinking.\n\nMy \"magic\" thinking, is what actually happened everywhere else. Communities grew, stabilized, declined, and were renewed to start the process over -- all driven by market forces. The only place that broke down? Where the government initiated red-lining.\n\nI truly do appreciate you citing a book predicated on ideology with no factual basis, ignoring the last 80 years of history, and then referring to my \"magic thinking\".",
