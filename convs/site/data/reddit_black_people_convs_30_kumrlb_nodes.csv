 this kind of thing, i'm lost. what kind of person defends, actually makes an issue of, a fantasy ""right"" to say something abhorrent and demeaning, for no reason? and, only where HE, feels it's safe. it tells you quite a lot about character.  it's pathetic.",-0.9201

I can't recall the context as to why he said it, but when he didn't see anything wrong with saying it because there's no black people in our group and therefore it's not in a context of racism or nastiness. I tried to explain why it's not ok for it to be said in any context by us, even if there isn't black people around.

We argued for quite a while and definitely got heated over it, and I'm still shaking and so angry because there was no getting him to understand that it's not a word that should be said in any context as there is no taking away the history of the word.

Anyway, I'm not looking for a debate or argument. I just needed to get it off my chest especially after he said it's not up to me to decide what the word means anyway because I am white.

I'm so damn angry! Sorry, needed to get it off my chest and written down somewhere.",-0.9892
