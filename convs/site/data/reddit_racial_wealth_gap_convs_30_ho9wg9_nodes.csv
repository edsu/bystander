&gt;During the last economic downturn, Black families experienced a 44.3% decline in median net worth, almost double that of White households, which only experienced a 26.1% drop, according to the Brookings Institution. 

&gt;To help narrow the gap, the policy roadmap proposes creating a public credit reporting agency housed within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This federally-backed credit bureau would “provide consumers with a government option that seeks to minimize racial disparities,” according to the document. 

&gt;The federally-backed credit bureau would be required to ensure that credit scoring was not discriminatory and that algorithms used for credit scoring would include non-traditional sources of credit data such as rental history and utility bills.

&gt;Once established, all federal lenders would be required to use and accept the federal credit agency’s scoring, including for programs such as federal home lending, PLUS loans and other loans that are guaranteed by the U.S. government. 

&gt;“There is a persistent, pernicious racial wealth gap that holds millions of Americans back, with the typical White household holds 10 times more wealth than the typical Black family,” the document says.",0.9882

In 2017, banks made over $11 billion dollars in overdraft fees. They are more than happy to let you overdraft so they can charge the huge fee.

Firstly, banks are in the business of making money, and they make money by making good loans. If they’re intentionally excluding an entire credit worthy racial group, they would have to lend to less credit worthy white borrowers and therefore have more of their loans turn bad.

The thing is that after redlining was made illegal, banks did lend with greater liberty to white people than to blacks. They were substantially more willing to lend to poor whites than poor blacks. However, the default rate among whites and blacks was the same, meaning that banks used the same credit risk management systems while lending to blacks as to whites. Blacks were just of greater credit risk and thereby received fewer loans even if they had a (relatively) high income. This is most likely due to things like employment history, which is an impossible metric to consider if you’re just looking at income.

In fact, countries that were previously or currently communist have the highest rate of home ownership worldwide*!  Followed by socialist countries. Now let's look past Wikipedia. What communist or former communist countries aren't counted? Vietnam, I wonder if that holds true: oh wow, 90%. It's almost like it's a trend or something. It's almost like home ownership flourishes when there are policies in place protecting citizens from the inflationary failed prospects of out-of-control wealth in relation to their dwellings. Things like multi-family, multi-generation, and adult children living at home have grown in the US, inflating these numbers artificially as no one in the census bureau is asking people if they have enough room or if they are comfortable.  

Let's go with the optimistic 65.3% now (63.8 according to census as of '18). Total livable housing in US: 139,684,244. Oh, but the population is ~328.2Mil, so we need more houses? No. There are 119,730,128 households. That's people living together. That's people living together even if they don't want to be, though, so how many is that? Well, there's at least about ~20 million houses there. 562,184 homeless people, could solve that and barely make a visible dent in the market. We've now got 19.5 Million homes left, and we've solved homelessness. Let's find the missing homes! Let's investigate! Oh look, I found at least 17Million of them: https://247wallst.com/housing/2019/09/30/there-are-over-17-million-vacant-homes-in-america/. Here's a take with different spin: https://www.worldpropertyjournal.com/real-estate-news/united-states/irvine/attom-data-solutions-q3-2019-vacant-property-zombie-foreclosure-report-2019-real-estate-news-zombie-homes-report-home-foreclosure-data-11538.php. Hmm, they're foreclosures, many of 'em. So it's as if the BANKS are SITTING on HOMES and LETTING them ROT to CHARGE YOU MORE FOR MORTGAGE! This is what happens when you let the TRADE UNIONS of FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) FUCK with your PEOPLE! Now's the part where you say that they're in rural areas and there aren't jobs there or something. Sure, some of them. Not that many. Your precious housing number didn't go down because people just moved in with their relatives when they were dispossessed! It's artificial scarcity created by finance to fund additional capital generation.
