I think the most important duty of a father, especially in the context of potential criminality of the child, is teaching moral lessons, because it takes a logical, non-emotional mind to do it. Mothers aren't naturally as good at that, because their neurons are closer together (meaning their emotions linger longer). Fathers are best suited for this, which makes their involvement in this way more important. Other activities, like bathing and feeding the child, will skew the data in irrelevant ways. You're right to be skeptical of marriage as a measure, but living arrangement is very important; split custody is also split discipline, which is likely bad for the child.",

I explained that the data you presented has too much irrelevancy to show that. What matters is imparted moral wisdom (often through discipline, but I dislike that word, because it implies negativity, which is counterproductive); time spent bathing and feeding children is ancillary. Living arrangement is a more accurate way of determining imparted moral wisdom, because \"time spent\" lumps in split custody. Split custody leads to split discipline, which is often bad.",

These measures are ancillary, as I stated.\n\nThat being said, I apologize for using imprecise language. More black dads are not living with their kids, which you want to claim is not walking out, but it has the same effect, and often the same blame. I'm focused on the effect on children, and who's to blame for it. That ain't bigoted. Caring about black children isn't bigoted.

A parent's emotions can get in the way of consistency and informing, leading a child to be confused, and then rebel to test boundaries. I wasn't even thinking about consistent moral lessons derived from empathy, or about empathy, but those can be insufficient, too.\n\nTeaching empathy, alone, can lead to a child that accepts being exploited, if they even accept the lesson, at all.\n\nTeaching with empathy, alone, can lead to the child rejecting moral lessons, because empathy isn't informational, so the child may not recognize the lessons as applicable to the world they see. This leads to an irrational urge to rebel.\n\nEmpathy isn't important at all. What's important is knowing how the world works, and how to get the most out of it. That means being a good person with other good people, but being more self-interested when dealing with antagonistic people. Both are needed for a child to be their best. Benefiting society is spillover.\n\nThe world is objectively a certain way. A parent needs to teach their child how it is, not how they want it to be, or how to behave in such an ideal world.",

But let's deal with that.\n\nYour inability to separate showing empathy with being unrealistic and/or \"uninformative\" is telling. Lack of self-respect and practice setting healthy boundaries is what causes exploitation. Those are extremely likely with a child insecurely attached to their parents.\n\nAlso, the world is actually not at all \"a certain way\". That's not how perception fundamentally works. Beyond that, teaching proper empathy *requires* acknowledging that the world is not roses and rainbows. You do not teach someone to have compassion by convincing them everyone is kind and upstanding. You do not teach someone grace in conflict without preparing them for conflicts. You do not teach someone to be humble without acknowledging there are complete assholes in the world. And you do not teach someone to take care of themselves by preparing them to be a walking doormat with no life skills or sense of self-preservation. You do not teach empathy by acting solely off emotion.\n\nIf your ideals involve benefitting yourself first, and others when convenient, then that is what you teach I suppose. Though I could see how that would lead to forgetting what morality means.\n\nBut I got my answer. You're about 50 miles off base with too many things you appear completely confident of your opinion about for me to attempt getting anywhere. I regret that you have had such negative interactions with the women in your life that you've decided they are incapable of being realistic, informative, level-headed, \"logical\", or consistent.

I also think your balance of pragmatism and empathy is ok.\n\nHowever, I still don't know if you're consistent in being informative. I've seen too many parents, especially women, use yelling and punishment instead of being informative. No view of morality can be taught that way. The problem was their emotion. That is why lacking emotion is so important for teaching morality.\n\nYou claim morality can be lost without empathy. That could happen.
