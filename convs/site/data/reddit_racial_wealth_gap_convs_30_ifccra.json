Wasn\u2019t FDR essentially in the position where he had to either apply redlining or alienate his party?\n\nRailing against the New Deal because of this discrimination sort of feels like railing against Obamacare because it didn\u2019t get universal coverage. Sure, we should strive for more, but given the political reality, it would have been politically unwieldy to push the envelope more. One ought to remember that the New Deal measures were a result of compromise.",
