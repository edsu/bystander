&amp;nbsp;
♦ Read the Guidelines/Rules/FAQ.
&amp;nbsp;
♦ Respect the women.
&amp;nbsp;

**GUIDELINES &amp; TIPS**
&amp;nbsp;

♛ 1. Slang and Word Policing is highly discouraged. That includes censorship of others that are within the rules. You're in the wrong place for that.


♛ 2. Answers come in variety. That means answers may be personal, subjective, or scientific in nature. They may derive from anecdotes or research. There are no strict answer guidelines to be followed.


♛ 3. Be respectful and civil of women answering the questions. Not every answer will be the same and every answer may not be what you want to hear.


♛ 4. Think before responding to questions. Not everything needs an immediate answer.

Is that just a byproduct of academia? I do not like socialism as far as what's been tried historically, the little I think I understand about economic incentives, and sheer annoyance of certain people that push socialism as being a quick fix/utopian ideal without discussing how it'd be implemented short of appealing to the caricature of free stuff for everybody ever.",0.3798

Racism isn't a class issue, it's a race issue. Indians are some of the highest earners in the US and UK...however, they still experience racism. That hasn't given them an elevated status.

In some parts, Indians butt heads with whites while other Asians get along fine. I think it’s poor whites who get jealous and also rich whites who look down upon poor minorities. There’s also racism between Chinese and Japanese here as well.",-0.4019
