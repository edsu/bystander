A bunch of pussies masquerading as hockey fans. It’s gotten worse and worse over the past year. The Don Cherry firing was a huge eye opener for me. Made me realize how many whiny bitches are in that subreddit. 

Honestly I feel like (as with the rest of the popular subreddits) the social justice takeover of r/hockey was astroturfed. It wasn’t some slow transition over a few years. It was like a normal subreddit, but whenever there was a “social justice”-related post, it would be boosted way to the top with upvotes. And all of the top comments would be completely in line with the social justice perspective. Any dissent got completely downvoted. Now with all this BurnLootMurder shit infecting entertainment, that subreddit is another astroturfed SJW-bullhorn. 

My team was knocked out of the playoffs in the first round so I was still watching just to enjoy seeing skilled players do their thing. But after they canceled games over the justified shooting of a criminal, the NHL and the players who participated in this stunt can go fuck themselves. I’m tired of the virtue signaling.",0.7992

 I don't really care about sports anymore after all of this either though. I already had one foot out the door but I'm done, there's better use of my time.
