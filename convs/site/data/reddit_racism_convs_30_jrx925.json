I do not like socialism as far as what's been tried historically, the little I think I understand about economic incentives, and sheer annoyance of certain people that push socialism as being a quick fix/utopian ideal without discussing how it'd be implemented short of appealing to the caricature of free stuff for everybody ever.",
