It reflects a progressive shift in treating violence as unacceptable and listening to victims of abuse, which encourages them to come forward in higher numbers. \n\nTo give an example, 50 years ago marital rape was LEGAL in the United States. A husband could not be prosecuted for forcing themselves on their wife because it was was seen as the wife's \"duty\" to always be sexually available. So of course the number of prosecutions today are higher than they were 50 years ago. \n\n40 years ago it was still common for credit card companies to refuse accounts to married women because finances were seen as the duty of a husband. That'd be both illegal and absolutely abhorrent today.\n\n30 years ago only 5% of the US house of representatives were women. Today it's 24%.\n\n20 years ago there was only one female CEO in the largest 500 companies, today it's 33.\n\nAs for the current political climate, progress is like a tide coming in. Each wave comes in then gets pushed back, but each subsequent wave gets further than the last. We're currently living through a period where the wave has fallen back, but it'll be back and stronger than ever.",

But all in all, many parts of the world have become more progressive in the long run on most issues. \n\nNow, this does not mean that you should become complacent and do nothing.

      "text": "You're right BunnyStats, we have made progress. But a lot of the examples you give are based around basic human decency and just not treating women as sub-human. I can't help but feel that we're mostly gaining token gestures though, enough to lull a lot of us into a false sense of security in believing a wave of progress is here or coming so we're blissfully hopeful and unaware of the conservatives quietly sneaking around and undoing decades of work. Look at the race stuff for instance. How many here thought racism was on the decline and black people were on the path to being treated equally, and that the US electing it's first black president was testiment to this and a major milestone in their push for equality? I did! Only for it to be exposed that they've been getting murdered, assaulted, abused and persecuted away from the public eye the entire time as white supremacists infiltrated the police and the racial wealth gap is as bad today as it was during the 1968 race riots. Black people were actually making less money in 2019 than in 2000, before Obama, yet the illusion of major progress was there.\n\nI fear for the same thing with women. It's great having some representation in the house, but with men still controlling more than three quarters of the house and over four fifths of the senate, how much can those women truly do? They couldn't stop the surge in violence against women, and we haven't been able to close the gender wage gap. The fortune 500 CEO thing is a nice stat but again it feels like more of a token/symbolic thing rather than a sign of true change. 33 out of 500 is still little more than 6%, and I saw the other day that female CEOs account for just over 5% of the biggest 4000 companies in the US compared to 3% 10 years prior. Men almost entirely exclusively run all of the world's countries and financial institutions and make up the top 1% and 10% wealth figures. At the rate we're going, in how many generations could you see us even making a dent in those areas? Because until we get ourselves at least a small piece of the most influential and powerful positions, I feel like we'll always be fighting an uphill battle scratching, clawing, struggling and persevering through violence, discrimination, systemic abuse, constant doubt and sabotage just to make baby steps towards true justice and equality that we ourselves will never see in our lifetimes.",

And you're right it's a slow process, it'll take generations before we might reach a state where I could say we have complete gender equality.\n\nI get how disheartening it can feel when there's all this pushback and things seem to get a little worse, but it's a sign that things are about to change! Pushback happens when the momentum for change becomes large enough that it's finally seen as a threat by the privileged.\n\nTake gay rights for example. Back in the 90s when I grew up, nobody even considered gay marriage a possibility. There were hopes for some kind of civil partnership recognition, but few dared dream of anything more. It was such a fringe idea it was rarely even a topic of conversation in the media. \n\nFast forward to 2010 and you'd think things had gotten worse. Anti-gay marriage laws were being enacted all over the southern states and the media was full of right wing folk talking about how gay marriage would be the end of civilization. The hostility towards lgbt+ folk felt far more visible than it had in the 90s. \n\nJump ahead 10 years and gay marriage is widespread in the Western world and opinion polls show public support for it is massive. Right wing folk don't even dare bring up gay marriage for fear of how unpopular such bigotry would make them.\n\nThe reason 2010 felt so terrible was because it was near the tipping point. I believe the same is true today in regards to racism. A year ago I would never have thought we'd see the US military and Nascar banning confederate flags, or widespread agreement on the need to remove confederate monuments, and yet here we are. These next few years are going to be rough, but the public has recognised how brutal the police can be, #metoo is still a powerful force, LGBT+ folk just got legal employment protections in the Supreme Court, and hopefully Trump and his cronies are going to be kicked out this November.\n\nAnd yes, you're right that all these things are baby steps, but that's how you run a marathon, one step at a time.",

      "text": "Yes the banning of some flags isn't going to magically make racism disappear, by itself it can seem a pretty tiny token gesture, but I think you might be missing the cultural impact such messages sends and how it changes norms. It reinforces the idea that celebration of the confederacy (and the racism it represents) is shameful. It's not going to make a KKK member embrace their neighbours of colour, but it is going to make them quieter as they realise their racist views are a minority and are deemed unacceptable by society. \n\nYou can see the impact of such cultural norms with how even racists find the label \"racist\" insulting and demeaning, they'll try to call themselves \"race realists\" or the like instead because there is now such a heavy cultural stigma against being called a racist. This marginalises the racists, it makes them have to speak in code, which in turn makes it harder for them to get their racist viewpoints across. It makes fewer folk want to associate with them, or hang around them, which makes their influence far weaker as the years go on.\n\nThis is a multi-generational struggle, changing a culture is never easy, but it is changing and in the long term it's changing for the better. If you're interested, I'd highly recommend reading up a little more on the events leading up to the civil rights act in '64. The situation today can seem dire, but when you hear about how much worse it was back then, wow, it can help highlight how far things have come, but also how far things still have to go.",

More and more places are trying to control women's reproductive rights, there is more push for women to just stay home and that there is something wrong with them if they don't want to, and porn is getting way more violent.
