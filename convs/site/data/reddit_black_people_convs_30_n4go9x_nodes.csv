so idk about u guys but i've never been harassed or threatened by a black person.

men, on the other hand, is a different story. women are harassed by men veryyy often.

You’re right in the fact that the previous statement was racist, but the “not all men” issue is backed by statistics showing that it is a very substantial number of them, and they may not even be 100% accurate because some people may not report incidents. It’s not sexist to point at statistics that prove that it’s not just a stereotype and base your thoughts and feelings on them, it’s just looking at the facts and preparing for the worst.

gwvo8uy,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/n4go9x/we_can_all_agree_that_saying_i_know_all_black/gwvo8uy/,VadeKing,"Alright so let’s do some math.

Total US population = 328.2 million

13.4% of the total US population is black so around 43,987,800 people in the US are black, cool.

The total number of offenses committed BY blacks is around 2,667,010 (whites are much higher with 7,014,550 meaning your “they commit more crimes on average” comment doesn’t work here) which means that only 2.8% of the black population commits a crime (and some of them could be repeat offenders)

So essentially 2.8% of 13% of the total US population could be trouble. Pretty small right? Now let’s look at some rape statistics.

Again, Total US population = 328.2 million

Men make up 49% of the total US population meaning roughly 157 million dudes are vibin here. That’s already a much bigger number right? It doesn’t stop there.

Roughly 91% of women have to deal with sexual assault and seeing as how someone has to make up the other 51% of the population (164 million) we can figure out that 149,240,000 women are raped or sexually assaulted. Okay thats a scary large number, so what percent of rapists have victims described as men?

99%. 99% of offenders described in these circumstances were male, meaning that roughly 147,747,600 were carried out by men. 

45% of the total US population have been offenders in some kind of sexual harassment or assault. When you say “it’s not all men” sure, you’re right, but there are HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS who are guilty of this. It’s unfair to look at 2.8% of the population and be weary of them, because it’s such a tiny section of the bigger picture. Yes they exist, but the chances of you ever running into someone like that is low. Now just consider for a second that HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of women have ALREADY been affected and have had encounters like this, and 45% of the entire population have been the ones to start these encounters. You’ve never had an issue with someone of another race but you’ve probably met a male that’s engaged in some kind of sexual harassment in your lifetime and you will further into the future. The statistics are nowhere near the same and they can’t at all be compared. Fearing 2.8% of 13% the population vs 45% is in no way comparable, and I think that women have plenty of justification for being weary after doing this math.

(Edit: Yes I did take an entire hour to write all of this out and do the math)

Edit part 2: It’s actually 97% of women. So allow me to rework my math for a second. 

159,080,000 women are victims of sexual harassment or assault meaning that around 157,489,200 men have engaged in some form of this. 

THATS 48% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION THAT WOMEN HAVE ALREADY BEEN HARASSED AND ASSAULTED BY.",-0.9932
gwvrffa,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/n4go9x/we_can_all_agree_that_saying_i_know_all_black/gwvrffa/,heavenlylord,"so you are saying that 99% of all men have committed sexual assault or harassment? that seems like an insane number.

I guess me and most of the other guys I know are in that super rare 1% of people who have never sexually assaulted a women.

&amp;#x200B;

But all the math and everything is irrelevant. From your logic, we understand that:

if men disproportionately commit rape and sexual assault (which they do), it makes sense to be cautious around them

if black people disproportionately commit crime (which they do), it makes sense to be cautious around them as well, even if you are just slightly more cautious

&amp;#x200B;

However, it seems that there is some threshold you have for when it is okay to be careful around a type of person. So I would ask: what percent of black people exactly would have to be criminals before it is okay to be afraid of them?",-0.9392

You’re not likely to meet any of them, and if you do then they most likely wouldn’t do anything to harm you any way so being nervous about the entire race is in fact racist. And I specifically mentioned that I was talking about sexual harassment AND assault. If it was just sexual assault then yes 99% would be an extreme, but I included sexual harassment because that is also an issue that needs to be addressed. I would like to ask why the math is irrelevant considering the fact that it proves that you objectively have no reason to fear black people and completely explains why women would be so cautious around men. You’re simply taking the things I say and finding what you want to hear and then acting as if that was my entire argument, when in fact by reviewing what I wrote it should be abundantly obvious that I was trying to dissuade you from being cautious around black people entirely. Instead of spending your time trying to make my argument invalid, I would like you to feel some empathy for women and understand where they’re coming from when they say these kinds of things and try to help change things so it’s safer for everyone instead of immediately calling them sexist.

Edit: It just occurred to me that you didn’t even try to understand the math if you’re assuming that i’m saying that 99% of men are offenders. 99% of sexual assault and harassment are committed by men, that doesn’t mean 99% of men it just means 99% of the total number of assaults were committed by men.",-0.9832

I say the math is irrelevant because I like to look at things in a more abstract way. Then we can apply the real-world scenario afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

If I was making your argument, this is how I would do it:

I think it is important to balance your personal feeling of safety and the harm you might do to others or a group of people.

For example, if you were to clutch your purse when a black person was approaching in a public place (which in SOME LOGICAL WAY does make sense, since your are somewhat MORE LIKELY to be robbed by that black person than a white person, on average), it is still a racist and bad thing to do. Why? Because the chance of you actually being robbed is still very low, and your action perpetuates a stereotype that black people are criminals and thugs, which is harmful in the long run. Your fear of being robbed is significantly exaggerated due to your racism, and your actions are unwarranted.

On the other hand, if you were a women walking alone at night and a man is approaching, there might be a pretty significant chance of something bad happening to you. The risk is significant enough that it does warrant action, and the harm done to men by perpetuating a stereotype is somewhat negligible.

&amp;#x200B;

If you take this position, however, you also have to accept that, if we lived in a hypothetical world where black people committed a massive amount of crime, it would be okay to engage in behavior considered racist by today's standards. I don't really think that is unreasonable to accept though.",-0.9848
