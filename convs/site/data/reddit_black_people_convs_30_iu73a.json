My meaning is that many people disagree with how the riots are going about, and from what I see in Portland the issue is outside groups using these protests to cause chaos while having nothing to do with blm. Of course even without Antifa our government has been known to use an agent provocateur to turn peaceful protests violent so they can bring in police.",
