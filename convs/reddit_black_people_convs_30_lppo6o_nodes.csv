If you asked anyone if black managers were under represented in England they'd probably tell you that they are but is it really true?

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52979173

This article would certainly give you the idea that it is.

Six black (or non white) managers out of 92 in the English professional game. That's 6.5%.

The article then goes on to talk about how 14% of the country is *BAME* to try and say that they're under represented. The thing is that a majority of those are Asian and aren't really involved in football at *any* level and meanwhile black players are *vastly* over represented in the PL but no one talks about *that* racial imbalance.

So compared to the general population black head coaches in England are actually slightly *over represented*. I doubt many people knew that.

Meanwhile ""The FA has set a target for 20% of the England team's coaching staff to be from a BAME background by the end of 2021"".

How on earth do you justify that? BAME people do *not* make up 20% of the population.

And, from the same article, you get ""Levi Desouza, a volunteer coach at Leicester Nirvana, says he's struggled to get jobs higher up the coaching ladder - and he can't understand why. ""I'm not trying to pull a race card or anything, but I've applied to clubs around Leicester. It's questionable why it's been overlooked"".""

In hindsight, maybe I shouldn't use so little words to discuss a serious subject to convey my point to begin with.

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify my point: 

There is no doubt that there is inequalities of opportunities based on race, the observation shouldn't based on looking at the current representation of POC coaches. Because we are not solving for equality in outcome, otherwise it will be similiar to saying we need to employ 1 POC trainer for every white trainer we employ elsewhere. 

What we need to do is to increase the opportunities given to BAME players who wish to transtition into coaching after their playing career has ended, and improve their employment prospect, as demonstrated in your source. So in the near future, employers (clubs) have a more racially diversed talent pool to hire from.

However, Seedorf's current situation sits above that, he already is a qualified trainer/coach. If he were to complain and said he wasn't given opportunities because he is black and justified it by saying there's no POC coach in ""top 5 leagues"" or football in general, that is something I just disagree. Because then in my opinion, he is no longer trying to compete the same position based on competency, but racial differences. Looking at the list of available coaches [here](https://www.transfermarkt.com/trainer/verfuegbaretrainer/statistik), I would struggle to justify between hiring Sarri (for example) and hiring Seedorf if we cast financials aside.

The % of BAME people in the UK was probably a lot lower than it is today when the current managers were young, so in 20-30 years time we will probably see alot of more BAME managers just because of interest and career opportunities is growing along with the BAME population, along with more BAME players going the managerial path.",0.8176

Looking at BAME players in the EFL is a useless metric, how many will be in the UK after they retire? In fact, how many will be in the UK in a year or two? Once you work out how many BAME players are British or plan to take their badges in the UK, you can then put together percentages to show if they are underrepresented or not. 

I know Henry and Vieria took their badges with the Welsh FA in 2016 (IIRC), so back then you could look at those two as potential BAME candidates who are in the UK looking for work, what good is looking at a black European player who has been in the UK for half a season? That just inflates the statistics 

I also think another factor is that a lot of managers nowadays finished playing in the last 20/30 years, how many black players were playing back then? Was there encouragement for them to get into coaching or not? That would also explain why the percentage of black coaches is low.

He hasn't argued for this position or stated it at any point in the comments in this chain. 

&gt; He says black people are not applying for coaching as it is a difficult job and requires work as if those reasons wouldnt stop white people either yet it doesn't.

No he really isn't. He's saying those two things separately. He's saying that it is a difficult job that requires a bunch of pre-work to be done to even be eligible. He's also saying that black people aren't doing that pre-work (no idea if that is true, but for argument's sake let's assume that black players don't get their coaching badges at the same rate as other players). He is saying that you can't claim that it is racism in the clubs not appointing black players as managers when there are so many fewer eligible former black players, because they aren't doing their badges. You speculated that these players are choosing not to do their badges because they perceive racism in the heirarchy, and he's saying that this is shit reasoning, because not even making yourself eligible to get the job means you are the reason that the job isn't going to you, not racism.

Again, I don't know what the actual numbers are. I don't have an opinion on whether it is racism or not that is holding back black managers. I don't know whether racism is what causes black people to be so massively over-represented in the Premier League as players either.

Football is incredible in its power to unite different races and for the diversity in many top leagues. However, there's a ridiculous amount of subtle (and not so subtle) racism - i.e. black players always being 'athletic', black midfielders only being compared with black midfielders, young black players being labelled troublesome while white equivalents are just cheeky chappies.

Perhaps instead of jumping to that, we can reserve judgment and try to find out more information, like 'do we think an unbiased selection of managers would reflect the player pool, or the society in which the league exists, or something else?' 'why is the player pool so heavily skewed towards certain races but not others?' 'why is the management pool skewed differently to the player pool?' 'what proportion of pro players end up choosing to earn their badges to become eligible to manage clubs?' 'how is this different between different types of players?' 'how is this different between players of different ethnicities?' 'how about different nationalities?'.

How many former goalkeepers do you know who went on to be managers in the top flight? I'd wager that an honest answer is going to be zero.

&gt;Teams managed by Barnes are taught to either hold or give the ball, though crucially they must do it at the right time. When in attack, Barnes' sides attempt to get the ball to the line at a variety of speeds ranging from slow to fast. In team talks Barnes always warns his players to be wary of the opposition's attempts to hit them and hurt them in both defence and attack. One criticism levelled at sides managed by Barnes is that one way they beat their opposition is as a result of getting around the back. John Barnes, although born in Jamaica, is a self proclaimed England man, and he refers to his tactical strategy as ""the masterplan"". Barnes is noted for his opposition to both hooliganism and football songs, and also for his firm belief that, with the crest of the club on their chests, his players cannot go wrong.

And even that isn't a guarantee. Ask Sol Campbell or Lilian Thuram. And they often say that defender tend to be great coach but two of the GREATEST  defenders of the history of the game where denied this right because they are black.

And when you finally have a chance, it always on tough spot like Henry with Monaco, Seedorf with Milan or Makelele with Bastia.

And if you fail, which was pretty much expected with such scenarios, then you will never have another chance in a top league. Like Makelele you will go to a little club in Belgium or like Henry in Canada to coach a MLS team.

The second scenario is to start very low like Vieira who played all his career in England and Italy and go to the US and then wait a chance to Europe.  Thanks to his connections with Manchester City otherwise like many others, he wouldn't even have a chance to coach a professonal club while being arguably the greatest box to box player in the history of the game...what a joke.

Nice finally gave him his chance but he was tricked. While Puel and Favre had great teams with players like Pereira, Plea, Ben Arfa, Belhanda,  Cyprien ( rated as good as Rabiot and Ndombele in France before the ACL ), Seri that played like Xavi, Dante which had something to prove after leaving Germany, Balotelli which played great to show that he was still good...

Vieira had a Nice team that sold all their good players + the owner sold the team with only left Dante which started to be very old, a damaged Cyprien and Balotelli frustrated to be so good under Favre but with no teams interested to sign during the summer so he first tried to go on a strike and finally came back in september in a bad shape. But the medias and the fans still expected to see Nice performs like they did with Puel last season and Favre 2 seasons...forgetting that Nice was always an average Ligue 1 team exept those 3 years where the scooting was great.

While when a white great player want to coach, it's not rare to see that he'll quickly find a TOP CLUB to coach like Guardiola, Zidane ( I know his origins is from Algeria but he can pass as white not like Benzema for example) or even worst Lampard or Arteta which didn't even coach the youth team 1 or 2 years before take over the top spot.

Good to average wiith players will also find a first or second division club of their country. And if they fail, they will have second or third chance before being ignored.

Even average players or amateur level players will have chances.

There are many systematic problems that attribute to this inequality in coaching. I think a lot stems from how black players are seen and scouted. When is the last time you heard someone in the media describe a black player as intelligent? Black players are always praised for the physical attributes but much less so for their brain. This is common in sports like American football as well. Because of this, I’d imagine it becomes harder for black players to transition to coaches. Players like Pirlo and Xavi have easily found work because they have always been consider intelligent players. But I imagine someone like Pogba will struggle to become a coach if he has those aspirations, because he always been considered a much more physical player, despite playing the same position as Pirlo and Xavi.",0.9276

I mean your really not deeping the argument at all are you. You're assuming the same barriers to entry don't exist at all coaching levels for minorities. Are you saying there are no minority youth coaches? Or just assuming they get chances at youth level?

Woooosh...Again Seedorf is a superstar, he is not the same as Nagglesman or Arteta or even someone like Mouriniho. Where are the minority versions of them?

&gt; Are you saying there are no minority youth coaches? Or just assuming they get chances at youth level?

That's a good point. Maybe those making the decisions at the less visible levels are more likely to be racially biased. I would again suggest for the managers listed, that there's probably less chance of that happening at the clubs they got the head positions due to their history with the clubs.

&gt; Mouriniho

I'm not sure what he's got to do with this. I thought we were talking about managers relatively new getting jobs easily based on race?

I'm not claiming bigger names are getting the job. I'm claiming managers with links as a player to their first managing job seem to get preferential treatment. Seedorf AC, Nagelsmann Hoffenheim Youth, Arteta Arsenal.

It's just another form of victim blaming but how are people supposed to know if they don't experience it.

&gt;I believe there is probably some racial bias, but I don't think shouting a few names of managers is enough to prove it.

So that's not what you said at first, now you're admitting it but you don't really want to accept it.

Study below showing racial makeups for playing and managerial staff in France, England and the Netherlands:

Of course it's off. But you've come to a conclusion with a single statistic, I'm suggesting that single statistic doesn't wholesale imply racism at every club in the world.

That statistic doesn't directly imply racism, it implies that for some reason the very natural career path of player to coach doesn't seem to happen for the majority of black players. ONE of those reasons could be racism (and might just be so!), but there are other reasons why it may not be so.

No shit Sherlock.

I'm not disputing that club connections don't get you further. I'm saying that systemic racism is obviously prevelant. It's not that people are evil, it's just stereotypes and tribalism that mean sees white coaches get more oppourtunities.

Agreed. The subject is complex and complex subjects have a myriad of contributing factors so it's important to weight how much ""systemic racism"" is contributing. This would be where you actually show some objective proof like I did rather than subjective reasoning but you don't have any because...

I'm not saying systemic racism is the evil white man keeping minorities down. It's usually a case of unconcious bias, we like people like us so the interviewer might just relate to the white candidates more which forms barriers for minorities who may be just as good, worse or better than candidates with this advantage.

You've shown objective proof that the number of black coaches compared to black players is significantly off.

Their input is completly valid and worth looking into. However Seedorf can only speak for himself, as those other managers can only do the same. I assume that black managers who don't feel they've experienced racism in their time coaching cannot wash over other experiecnes either with ""well it hasn't happened to me"".
