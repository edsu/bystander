[this will be a major focus for her administration](https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1321879231794712576). Raising the minimum wage for all? No. Equalizing things that can't be equalized? Yeah let's do that pandering for 4 years. Guys be real, Kamala isn't gonna do $15 min wage or equalize latina women and white man pay. It's weird to focus in on groups the way she does. It's all words.

Push for Automatic Voter Registration &amp; Universal Mail In Voting for a start. That in turn will make it easy to vote, leading to less voter suppression and more young folks voting.

Also we need to get the the third parties to stop going on about 5% and start working on Ranked Choice Voting. Our First Past The Post System means there will be no viable 3rd parties.

Lastly we need to kill off the 2 big wedge issues. 

Drop Gun Control. Completely. You're never going to win it, all you're going to do is lose elections. Let people have their freaking guns. You'll save more lives that way. 

Next, we need to stop saying ""pro-choice/life"". This is the right wing framing and it was chosen specifically because both are good things and hard to argue against. 

Call it what it is, Criminalization, and remind people that when it's illegal there has to be punishment, the punishment will be death or life in prison and it will be applied to miscarriages.",-0.9817

But yes, I think going the identity politics route, is a bad idea.  For instance, if people were protesting against police violence and abusive of authority period, I think they woudl have more allies and less enemies, then by making it a racial thing.  If you solve the problem of police abuse of authority and lack of accountability, you solve the problems with it for minorities and everyone else.

Thing is, the fields of critical theory have a pretty solid hold across the universities, and they're churning out ""activists"" left and right, who have no option but to go to the left, and try to twist it into what they want.  Identity politics isn't going anywhere, and it only makes things worse, it just creates more and more lines to divide ourselves by.",-0.9879

Anything beyond background checks isn't going to happen because it doesn't have widespread popular support.
