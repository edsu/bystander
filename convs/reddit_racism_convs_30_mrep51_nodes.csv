I say what I mean and I mean what I say. If I said it, I stand by it. If I no longer stand by it, I will say so. If I haven't said so, you can be assured I still stand by it.

I've been called racist, transphobic, misogynistic. All because I like to hold the middle ground, try to see as many views as I can and generally follow facts, data and statistics more than feelings, anecdotes and hearsay. 

It used to bother me, now it doesn't. I let people make up their own damn minds about me, they will anyway so why should I give a fuck. I know I'm none of those things, and that's enough.",-0.83
