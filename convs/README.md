The files in *data* were generated by the *Conversation Graphs* notebook in the directory above. They represent a simplified network view of the different sampled conversations. Each file corresponds to a platform (Twitter or Reddit) followed by the search query used, and then the conversation id, and a file format. The *_edges.csv* files are edge list of source and target ids. The *_nodes.csv* files are nodes and minimal metadata about the post (url, user, text, sentiment). the JSON file contains the edges and nodes in one structured JSON document.
