The cost of this was so great that it was finally repaid in 2015 meaning English people today have paid to end slavery. At the time, the British navy dedicated 1/6th of its fleet to hunting down slavers. 20,000 royal marines died in the process from what I've read.   \n\n\nWe've been through supremacy, have the t-shirt and the old photos to prove it, and have *culturally matured past it.*   \n\n\nOther cultures like Saudi Arabia ended slavery in 1962. You didn't read that wrong, it really is that late.
