And tbh that kind of shit can even be funny sometimes when it\u2019s not constantly making fun of just one group. I\u2019ve mellowed out to jokes involving my people since and I\u2019m glad I did. I\u2019ve heard some great jokes and by not being confrontational, I have helped inform the more ignorant types. A few years back a party I used to roll with kicked out a dude because when he drank he would get really angry and yell and say slurs with real anger in his voice. A joke on occasion is one thing, but when you start yelling the nword at a players, there\u2019s not any real defense for being that.",
