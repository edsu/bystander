You'd need some outside capital to supply that - even if the rent goes to a landlord, the landlord pays back a mortgage to a bank. We can talk about the discrimination and how to fix things like credit systems - but the funds will still be flowing outside the community (it just passes from the landlord into the bank that issued the loan).   \n\n\nBut regardless - getting a loan to buy property you can't afford does not necessarily build wealth. Creating a gap between income and spending is what gives you surplus money (which if invested - in real estate, equities elsewhere) builds wealth.  \n\n\nSo when we talk about fixing structural inequality we should be focused on that specific equation - what makes it impossible to create a gap between income and spending. Some of it does come down to financial education, and some of it also comes down to inherent inequalities.",
