Cutting a bracket will benefit all earners whose income falls at least within that bracket. Cutting a lower bracket will benefit everyone in that bracket and higher, including the highest incomes. So what's the point of cutting taxes for the highest income? Answer this, without claiming that there are broad societal benefits to rich people getting more money first (because if you did make this claim, you're defending trickle down explicitly).",

These communities were even more desperately poor before these policies were in place, when rates of two-parent households in these communities were much higher.  In areas where black communities attained more wealth they tended to be systematically destroyed by racist development policies.
