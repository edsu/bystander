Not doing jokes about black people is just ignoring they exist which is surely more offensive?

In fact Jim Davidson actually points out that black people are targeted for their skin colour at the start of his bit and refers to black people as cousins. That’s positive. The offence is because he did an accent. When it comes to comedic value, it’s not funny. Most of Jim Davidson’s comedy isn’t funny but that’s besides the point of comedy. It’s subjective.

The fact is many black comedians have done exactly this and to call to censor stereotyping is utterly ridiculous. All white people cannot dance? Come on, we know that’s not true. As a sweeping generalisation it probably is though, the majority cannot. For comedic purposes it’s hilarious. Why can’t that be used in comedy? 

The rocky stuff about Italians is brilliant too. The accent he has makes it even funnier.

Richard Pryor’s skit on white people’s insults is absolutely hilarious. Of course that’s stereotyping a race but it’s funny. Especially in the accent he executes it in

For example if a guy was to make fun of gay people, if he’s gay, then it’s allowed. The same joke delivered by a straight guy is considered homophobic and offensive. So a black guy ridiculing black people for the purpose of a joke is perfectly acceptable in that sense.

However, many black comedians do stereotypical white guy impressions too.

Richard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock have all adopted stereotypical humour and using generalisations on white people in their routines, even adopting the accent. (like Jim Davidson did).

You know what? It’s hilarious too. I don’t find it offensive as a white person. 

I don’t get what the difference is other than Jim Davidson isn’t in their league for using the exact same techniques in comedy. He wasn’t malicious, it wasn’t hate-filled but the perception is different.
