I believe the company has the potential to be around longer than the 2-5 years brands have these days before the fashion culture phases them out because of their values &amp; their quality. I don’t want some bots ruining that for them.,0.25

I get their trying to say the more you supply the demand will level out but I don’t think the point was leveling out the demand (only) I think it was to keep the integrity of the brand too with “affordable luxury”,0.34
