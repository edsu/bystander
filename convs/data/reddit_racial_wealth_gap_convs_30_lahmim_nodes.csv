It is incredibly stupid that we pay any interest on student loans. I have been paying my $50K in loans off for 20 years now and have only started paying down the principal in the last few years.

I'd like to see a tax credit issued for 100% of student loan interest that can be used to offset tax bills over a 1-5 year range depending on the amount of the credit. This could be retroactive for the last 30 or so years, which would make it more palatable for those who no longer have student loan debt, but who paid lots of interest when they did have debt.

Maybe add a credit of say $10-15K of forgiveness for principal as a sweetener, but I'd be happy just to have the interest forgiven since it is such a huge part of the expense and really can't be justified by banks when the government guarantees much of that debt.",0.9697

There are way more white people that went to college than black.  And it is those with college degrees that make way more money on average than those that never went to school.

Forgiving student loans would only increase the divide between the wealthier (in this case upper middle class) and poor (who are mainly people who didn't get college degrees including most minorities who would get zero dollars if student loans are forgiven).  It would mainly hurt minorities, not help.",0.3054

Basically, the quicker you pay off your student loans, the more the government pays into your outstanding balance - it doesn't have to be 1-to-1. Maybe like 10-25% of what you pay a year the government will match in the first five years of the loan. So if you pay 5,000 a year, then the government would match $1,250.

This would encourage those who could pay but chose not to pay more than the minimum do to so. An incentive strategy, if you will.",0.9628

glodcjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/lahmim/what_canceling_student_debt_would_do_for_the/glodcjt/,Ganrokh,"This opinion piece is looking at it the wrong way. 

The argument that it's making is that the bulk of the money meant to forgive student loans is going to the top 40% of households because richer folk tend to have high-paying jobs that require more expensive degrees. While this may be true (I'm unable to research the numbers right now), that isn't a problem. I'm lower-middle class. I owe $12k. I should only get $12k and not expect more. I shouldn't be upset that someone higher-class than me is getting more loan relief money because they have a more expensive degree.

When student loan relief is a serious item being considered in Congress, whoever wrote the bill won't be pulling a cost out of thin air and trying to figure out how to forgive that much debt. They're going to figure out who they want to forgive the debt for (IE families earning under $125k, like Biden campaigned on for full forgiveness) and calculate the cost of forgiving loans for that group. In that case, no one should be mad that someone in the upper class with $100k in loans is getting forgiveness because they're not taking it away from someone in the lower class with $10k in loans.

The metric should be the number of people helped, not the amount of money spent on which social class.",0.9315
