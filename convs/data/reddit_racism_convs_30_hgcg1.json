Justin Trudeau wore blackface, apologized, stated he was wrong, is still employed and will work again. He didn't try to convince the public it didn't happen. Mark Saunders's response is literally \"Who are these people?\" \"No one knows them in the community\" when the interviewer confronts him.  Classic power imbalance. The criticizers are not known enough to have an affect on him? Some people snake by through life and some have integrity. Some respect and excuse the former, some the latter. To each their own.",
