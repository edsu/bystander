      "text": "I really really like this idea and wish it got more traction. For those too lazy to read it basically institutes a program where every baby thats born in the US gets a bond that matures when they turn 18 and the amount paid out depends on the parents income through the kids life. \n\nThe problem today is that capital is extremely important in getting your adult life started and many minority children don\u2019t have access to capital from their parents. If you want to go to school, you need capital to pay tuition (loans are just an expensive way of raising capital), if you want to start a small business you need capital to buy assets, if you want to just live on your own in a safe environment and find a job after graduating you need capital to pay your security deposit on an apartment. A lot of young adults are kind of just thrown to the wolves at 18/21, a few grand could go a long long way to help them reach some stability in their life. \n\nObviously there\u2019d need to be protections on the money so the program cant be gutted, and rules so that the money can only be spent on certain things (this is mainly so it can get bipartisan support). Implementation wise I think what would be fair is start giving current rising 18 year olds a small amount (maybe like 500-1000) and slowly sliding it up every year so that in 18 years the program reaches full payment status. I also think that the amount richer kids receive and the amount poorer kids receive should be similar. While its not the most efficient distribution of resources, its the policy that would get the most support from Americans which is extremely important.",

      "text": "The problem is that most not some of that money will imo end up be spent on stupid things. This is a naive 18 year old who'd just became an adult with not much responsibilities, I just don't see how we'll get a scenario where the kid just doesn't blow most of that money in celebration of turning into an adult and enjoying some of the benefits that come with that. I could even see this turn into a cultural thing where kids all over the US eagerly wait for their 18th birthday just so that they'll be given a couple grand all to themselves that they could then blow on whatever they want.\n\nSome people even argue that these kids aren't even smart enough to be held liable for life changing decisions they made at that age in regards to university, yet they think these kids are somehow going to be financially responsible enough with this money at the same age?\n\nThe 1200 dollars a few months ago is not even remotely comparable. Millions of people lost their jobs, they had no income and had bills to pay. Most of that money was probably spent responsibly towards paying their bills. \n\nAs for the proposed solutions,\n\nI like the idea that we could restrict what this money is spent on. I may have concerns about whether this can be properly observed and regulated however.\n\nThe bond maturing partially idea I don't see working. The less the money the person gets at one time the more likely he is going to blow it on some stupid stuff rather than invest it responsibly. I think you're actually more likely to spend more of your money responsibly if you get bequeathed a large sum straight away than being given parts of it throughout time. To take an extreme example, are you more likely to invest your money if you're given 5000 in one shot or 500 every year for 10 years? I think the former.",

      "text": "It\u2019s...a lot more complicated than that.  \n\nThere are nuggets of truth in some of what your saying, but taking them out of context for Twitter level consumption is dangerous.  And why I don\u2019t like Twitter, these issues are complex and deserve long form conversation to come to terms with. \n\nTake for instance your comment on Fatherless house holds.  The US has finally realized that yes, just about every metric available shows children of multi-parent homes enjoy privilege and success above their single parent counterparts in the aggregate (My parents split when I was young and I found success, but it was an uphill battle).\n\nMuch of that angst against that truth had to do with the concept of a \u201cnuclear family\u201d being touted by, and for the consumption of the Christian right and ideals.  This caused a knee jerk reaction from the left who saw it as demonization of single mothers (and make no mistake, the way the conversation was formatted it was just that). \n\nRegardless of the intent of either side of that argument the data, which is what matters, proved that children of single parents (female or male) tend to find it harder to gain traction. \n\nBreak the racial demographics down, and ask why the spikes in single mothers in some minority communities?  \n\nAgain it\u2019s complex, and I can\u2019t do it justice here, but to highlight one aspect of many:  A community is disenfranchised from strong institutions and fair employment.  They engage in sometimes less than legal commerce to make ends meet, and also do not feel they can rely on those institutions for conflict resolution.  So they have to resolve conflicts the old fashioned way.  Your damned self.  This always escalates.\n\nThis brings them in contact with the wrong side of the law, and thus begins another cycle of responses and disenfranchisement.  A lot of fathers either in jail or unemployable and in the extreme, dead. A lot of fatherless households.  Some of this is coming to a head right now! \n\nAll of this is interconnected in complex ways that feed off each other.  Yes a child in a fatherless household is at a disadvantage.  For various reasons.  But you have to ask *why* these spikes occurred in various points in time and places and peoples.  \n\nWhere I break from many is I don\u2019t see it as purely a problem of re-enfranchisement.  Some of the problems were caused by it, but it existed for so long as to create some...less than positive sub-cultural behavior that normalized in certain areas.  \n\nAnd this isn\u2019t \u201cboth sides maaaan\u201d.  There are no sides.  That\u2019s just being used as an intellectually regressive bailout so people don\u2019t have to mentally engage in discussion or empathize with people that don\u2019t fit into ideological box someone else built for them.  (Increasingly at least, I have seen the both sides thing abused the other way to be sure).\n\nIt\u2019s understanding, the best you can-people.  You are hard pressed to go to a community and ask a parent to emphasize the value in education when that system has not worked for them for generations.  But you also have to be willing to admit that the children are not getting the extracurricular reenforcement at home (what was the point before really) and do something about it when you do fix that education system, and do it in a way that is respectful and not patronizing as hell.  \n\nI\u2019m probably in a minority in that though.",
