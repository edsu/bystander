Most people who want to do trickle down policy are quite consciously aware that they can't actually call it trickle down, since it would be too uncouth.

Rather, it's more politically useful to pretend that their policies have broad positive societal impacts, rather than the actual impact which just increases the wealth of those who already have wealth and the incomes of those who already have incomes.

For example, the US uses marginal income tax brackets. Cutting a bracket will benefit all earners whose income falls at least within that bracket. Cutting a lower bracket will benefit everyone in that bracket and higher, including the highest incomes. So what's the point of cutting taxes for the highest income? Answer this, without claiming that there are broad societal benefits to rich people getting more money first (because if you did make this claim, you're defending trickle down explicitly).",0.9662

Turns out when a lot of people chase the same education with the goal of gaining high-earning employment it results in a glut of workers in the field and lower wages.  There are a lot of programmers out there working tech support jobs, PHD's delivering pizzas, etc...  I'm sure the picture looks rosier for people who have jobs and go to work surrounded by people with jobs, but the injunction to just chase STEM isn't as helpful as it once was.",-0.2728

There's a kernel of truth to this right-wing talking point that mostly has to do with public housing policies in the 60's.  Families would have to pretend to not have a father in order to get out of the slums and into public housing.  I know couples who aren't legally married for benefits reasons even today

Of course the attempt to blame poverty on these perverse incentives of our anemic welfare system is totally absurd.  These communities were even more desperately poor before these policies were in place, when rates of two-parent households in these communities were much higher.  In areas where black communities attained more wealth they tended to be systematically destroyed by racist development policies.  Redlined, bulldozed for freeway construction, and in a few cases burned down in race riots.  The neoliberal turn in economic policy then reduced social mobility and left these people right where they were.",-0.9439

It is bullshit to think that STEM people aren't motivated to learn.  I am in IT and if a employer can outsource the job, then they would.  However, there are also contracting companies that bring in foreign workers have them work here in the US for dirt cheap, and pass the savings onto the major corporation.  Don't blame the workers blame the employers who also set extremely high bars to get local citizens in because if they fake that they can find a cheaper contractor who is using foreign talent.",-0.8975
