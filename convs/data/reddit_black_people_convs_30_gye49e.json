It's an analogy I am using to explore how someone can be individually innocent but still \"bad\" if they are part of a greater more evil system.\n\nAgain, agree with this does not mean that you necessarily have to believe that the US police system is *also* evil or just as evil/bad/toxic/whatever as the gestapo. Not at all! It is simply exploring how a person can be part of and complicit in the actions of the organizations they are a part of.\n\nMaybe you don't agree, and you think Hans bears no responsibility of guilt for the crimes of other gestapo agents that he did not know about.

It's saying that the system is racist and, as your definition said, systemic problems affect all parts of something. That does not mean that every single cop is individually racist, it means the system is racist itself is. An single person might not believe racist things, but if their work perpetuates a system that is racist, then they are complicit.\n\nIf a carpenter isn't racist but sells a wooden cross to a KKK member knowing full well who they are, is the carpenter absolved of guilt when that is burnt on someone's lawn?\n\n&gt;The clerks, the accountants, the trainers, the front desk staff, the payroll, the HR, they are all racist/part of the racist problem.\n\nNo, not \"they are all racist\", only \"they are all part of the racist problem\".\n\nDo you understand how a single person could be no racist themselves, but actively participate in a racist system? \n\nLet's take the clerk. A cop who is an out and out racist beats the shit out of and arrests a completely innocent black person. The clerk knows none of the details of this interaction, all they do is take the paperwork filled out by the cop (filled with lies about feeling like their life was in danger), put a stamp on it, and enter it into the system.\n\nDid assist in the execution of a racist act? Are they completely removed from the racism of the cop, because from their position they did nothing overtly racist?\n\n&gt;I'm asking you to prove this racism/discrimination, with a little bit more than \"this station/that station\".\n\nIs it possible for someone to participate in a racist system without themselves being racist?",
