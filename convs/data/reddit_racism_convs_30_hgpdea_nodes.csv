Reverse racism is a term that’s used to describe white’s being the victims of racial prejudice because many people feel that white people cant experience racism. 

It is, as you say however, still ‘racism’.",-0.9383

Racial prejudice is judging somebody differently because of their race, which can be done towards any race (eg white people cant dance)

Racism is different because of the power dynamic. When white people are racist towards black people for example, because white people are the group with the most power by far this has more of an impact within society. When a black person does the same to a white person, it has little effect beyond just that person and those around them.

Another way to think of it is “punching up” vs “punching down”. A comedian who makes fun of people more powerful than them is punching upwards which is obviously much less effective given the receiver’s position. A comedian punching down makes fun of those below them which has much more of an impact.",0.7842
