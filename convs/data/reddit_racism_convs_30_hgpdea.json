      "text": "There is a key difference between racial prejudice and racism. (A couple of dictionaries are working on changing definitions regarding this I believe)\n\nRacial prejudice is judging somebody differently because of their race, which can be done towards any race (eg white people cant dance)\n\nRacism is different because of the power dynamic. When white people are racist towards black people for example, because white people are the group with the most power by far this has more of an impact within society. When a black person does the same to a white person, it has little effect beyond just that person and those around them.\n\nAnother way to think of it is \u201cpunching up\u201d vs \u201cpunching down\u201d. A comedian who makes fun of people more powerful than them is punching upwards which is obviously much less effective given the receiver\u2019s position. A comedian punching down makes fun of those below them which has much more of an impact.",
