g2bnps4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lethbridge/comments/idu5az/racism_in_lethbridge/g2bnps4/,SamsonsRevenge,"Most of the racism in Lethbridge is due to tensions between the “white” and aboriginal communities. I use “white” because the majority of the population is of that racial orientation. 

Honestly most of it isn’t very overt. It’s more discomfort. Most of the homeless drug addicts down town happen to be aboriginal, and there is a very clear social and economic divide. Most people individually aren’t racist, a lot of it is just a defense mechanism for being implied to be racist due to social and economic forces outside of their control. 

Anyways, I’m originally from the Calgary area, and I don’t think Lethbridge is really any more or less racist than there. But, I’m also a white male who doesn’t really hang out with racist people. So maybe I just have sample bias.",-0.9429

It is very difficult for people to confront racism for that reason. 

We can all (well most people anyway) agree that the residential school system was racist and evil. Alberta had more kids in res school that other provinces. The last res school ended in 1996. 

The reality is that tens of thousands of church officials, government workers, lawyers, social workers, teachers and police officers created and maintained this system of horrific abuse for decades. It’s not an abstract concept. Actual people, many of whom are part of respected professions were involved.

Odds are you know people who were involved in one capacity or an other.

It’s a very sensitive topic but the post is to spark genuine discussion and conversation.

I saw a post earlier on the sub bringing up racism and the post had a fair bit of buzz which got me thinking I wasn’t alone in the whole “Lethbridge racism” thing. It was something I always felt was around and would casually joke with friends about it, but never really got anyone’s genuine experiences on the matter. However, Seeing the post earlier made me interested in what other peoples experiences were on the topic. Growing up in Calgary half of my life left me with a lot of mixed experiences on the matter, but moving to Lethbridge last year made me feel more uncomfortable than I’d ever been in Calgary. There was never any overt experiences I could really attribute to these feelings other than a lot of mistreatment and bullying by new peers—but I’d never feel comfortable jumping to “racism”. 

Another matter different from Calgary (south) is that there’s a high number of indigenous people, toward whom Ive unfortunately heard more racist comments thrown at than any other place I’ve been to. There were always similar hostilities in Calgary, but it feels distinctly greater out here.
