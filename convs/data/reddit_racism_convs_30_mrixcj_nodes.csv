I brought up the definition of words as to what racism specifically is because it’s geared towards one race (I read your post and article). If you want to truly end racism and bigotry (or present it in a game like fashion) you must include all races and not focus on just one. E.g. my comment about racism only impacting one race which is false and it happens all over the world against all races.",-0.872

The intelligent people who record English language dictionaries record a words *use* (which is why they recognize the figurative definition of the word literally) and not how the word is defined in specific fields, which is why you have dictionaries of x specialized field ( ie medical dictionaries, theological dictionaries,) these are objects one comes across when they reach a higher education level than a high school diploma

Except the word “only” there is your interpolation.
