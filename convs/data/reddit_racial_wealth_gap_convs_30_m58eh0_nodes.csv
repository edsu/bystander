It's a difference, not a gap. There is no reason for arbitrary groups (such as sex or race) of people to make the same income, or control the same wealth, whether in aggregate, or per capita.

&gt;That's not an imbalance. 

I never claimed it's an ""imbalance"". I said that it's *not* a gap.

&gt;even after accounting for maternity leave, time taken off, and career choice. 

That's not how this works. You don't start with a total, then pick variables that you can measure, and then say that, when you fail to account for the difference between totals, there's a problem.

Difference in outcomes between arbitrary groups are not evidence of a problem or systemic disproportionate discrimination between those groups.

What is an ""imbalance"" is that women control more wealth than they earn. According to you, women control exactly the share of wealth proportional to their fraction of the population. Yet, also according to you, women receive only 80% as much income as their fraction of the population ""deserves"" (I disagree with this deserving-ness. It's not a gap, just a difference.) But, if we take both of your ideas, and combine them, we see that women control \~51% of the wealth after earning just 40% of the income. I would much rather control 1.275% of the wealth per 1% of the income I earn (women) vs controlling .82% of the wealth per 1% of the income I earn (men). Wealth is all that matters (economically). Income is just the primary way to increase wealth. I would rather increase wealth without any income than have a huge income and while not increasing wealth, just like any rational agent.",0.9884

But why adjust for a difference that exists? Why not just let differences exist? Do we need to adjust for the fact that I don't have a billionaire daddy, a 200 IQ, etc? People are not the same, and that's perfectly fine. I expect smarter people to end up wealthier than dumber people. This isn't something that should be ""adjusted for"".

&gt;A problem when assessing a gender pay gap 

It's not a problem. You're begging the question.

There is no gap.

There is a difference.

Despite the difference, women control *more* wealth than men!

&gt;They’re several other things that are very difficult to adjust for. 

You don't need to adjust for anything. Arbitrary groups of people can earn different incomes and have different wealths and all kinds of different outcomes! It's totally fine! Remember, you're on the political 'side' that supposedly champions diversity!

&gt;If it can be shown that women get paid less for doing the exact same work as men, than that is a problem that needs to be fixed. 

Well, pretty much everyone agrees about this. We outlawed this in the 1960s. We signed a bullshit Equal Pay Act at the end of Obama's term to sucker women into voting for Democrats. Nobody gets paid less for doing the exact same work as anyone else. It doesn't matter if it's men/women or any other arbitrary category: it matters at the individual level. And guess what? If there's even remotely vigorous market competition, anyone who pays people less than they're worth gets fucked by someone even *slightly* less bigoted: I could crush so many industries by just hiring women or blacks or whatever class you think is discriminated against, because my labor cost would be cheaper than the disproportionately male, white, or whatever class you think is discriminated in favor of. Not only would I pay less than my competitors for equal (or superior) output, all the previously discriminated-against labor that would flock to my companies would be getting raises relative to their prior employment arrangements! But, no need to worry about this, since the 60s, you could always sue someone for paying people differently for the same work. I'm pretty sure it doesn't even have to involve sex (it's not gender), race, or any ""protected class"". If you think this is happening with men vs women, go win some massive class-action lawsuits! Hire all the amazing female workers at a discount while simultaneously giving them raises, and crush the competition! Don't write bullshit articles about a pay ""gap""! Capitalize on it!",0.9891

My problem is with ambiguous topics like discrimination within a work force and it being prescribed to wage discrepancies without any outstanding evidence. It can be a very dangerous game to play that can favor any agenda as it speculates on ambiguity. Ascribing narratives is perfectly reasonable within an opinion piece but not within scientific research. The first link has a section on “what role do “unobservables” like discrimination and productivity play in the wage gap” in which there is much more ambiguity and attempts to prescribe reasoning to the “unexplained portions” of the gender gap. Within that portion they cite a study where the unexplained portion of the gender gap has decreased from 1980 to 1989. What this gap is and how it can be defined is completely subjective with no absolute consensus. There are much more linear things that can be examined regarding the gender pay gap that get us closer to the “truth”. My problem with the paper you first linked is that it toes the line of ambiguity in that section. It does a good job of compiling papers from other researchers but it also speculates on non sequiturs given that there isn’t any concrete descriptive claims made that conform to the overall consensus regarding the gender pay gap.,0.5571
