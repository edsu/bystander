The article goes over education, personal responsibility, home ownership, individual accomplishment, increased savings, black-owned bank investment, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, emulating ""model minorities"", and 'stronger family ties'. 

Each section has numbers, links to the studies, and links to specific articles that go more in depth on each issue.

While yes financial literacy and schooling are likely not the solution for a wealth gap issue, but they are very likely part of any solution for a wealth gap issue. 

The one that really aggravates me in this article is how they looked at the ""myth of closing the racial wealth gap through stronger families"" and then proceed to compare black women to white women. You are seeking to disprove that stronger family units with both a mother and father present is going to help their children succeed and break out of the cycle of poverty by comparing white women to black women. Why don't you compare black households with two parents and black households with one parent? Seems like a more accurate comparison to see if that ""myth"" really exists. And it is pretty much accepted that growing up in a single parent household puts children at a disadvantage and increases the likelihood that they will drop out of school and get involved in criminal activity. Now is addressing the issue of single parenthood going to solve the wealth gap? Not by itself, but it is also part of any solution to address poverty in general.",0.9782

Racist means "" showing or feeling discrimination or prejudice against people of other races, or believing that a particular race is superior to another.""

A policy isn't racist just because if favors another race.  It requires more than that to be racist.

But let's address your point....I am in the same boat as you, my grandparents moved here post-1900.  My family had nothing to do with slavery, many/most white Americans didn't.

But the goal of reparations isn't punishment and if it were done, it wouldn't be levied against white people alone, it would be a national/state/local budgetary decision.

Now, yes, your taxes and my taxes would contribute to the reparations, but it's not designed as a punishment.  And yes, we'd be treating people differently because of their race.

But the argument FOR reparations is that national policy (allowing slavery) is a major contributing factor for black americans entering a cycle of poverty that still disproportionately affects them to this day.  It's not about white people being punished, it's about the entire nation (the one our families moved to) admitting that national actions caused harm.

So....let's stop calling it racist, stop calling it a punishment and discuss it for what it is....i think there are lots of rational reasons to oppose reparations, but you're not making those arguments.

*Edit: There is a curious obsession here with insisting that just because race is part of a law, that makes the law ""racist"".   That has never been the case.  There are differences between ""racially disparate impact"", ""systemic racism"" and ""racism""....they're a venn diagram, but y'all are trying to make them all have the same meaning.

It is racism; the entire point is that people are to be treated and regarded as members of a racial group.  Think of it this way, if descendants of people who lived generations ago are entitled to a benefit, what about the descendants of people who committed crimes against that first group decades ago?  Would you punish the descendants for crimes of the forefathers?  What is racism if it's not thinking of people as parts of a group, which would include descendants of the same tribe?

Also, what about seeking reparations from descendants of Africans who captured and sold other Africans into slavery?  Should some African nations be made to pay reparations?

&gt; The wealth and greatness of our nation was in-part built on the back of slaves, who did not get their share of that wealth for the work they performed.

Not really; that's a popular bromide.  The amount of wealth in existence today has to be hundreds of times what existed 150 years ago.  The wealth we have today is based primarily on technological advance and work performed more recently over the past few decades.  To the extent our wealth is based on work done 150 years ago, it's only really attributable to past scientists and engineers who fostered technological advanced and not people performing manual labor.

&gt; Being paid the value for work performed, that was unjustly denied, falls plainly under valid legal restitution theories.

The problem is that the people who performed the work are long since dead as are the people that directly benefited from it.  There are no victims left alive to compensate and no perpetrators left alive to take the money from.  Also, the manual labor that was done over 150 years ago really wouldn't have much value today.

American blacks are not the only group that has suffered injustice in the past.  Descendants of Irish immigrants could argue that the UK owes them reparations.  Descendants of Armenians could argue that Turkey owes them reparations.  Descendants of some Indian tribes could argue that descendants of the Aztecs owe them compensation.  Descendants of Jews could argue that Europe and Russia (and maybe most of the world?) owes them reparation for pogroms committed against them in the past, descendants of American Chinese immigrants could argue they are owed reparations for discrimination they suffered hundreds of years ago, etc.  Where would seeking reparations for historical wrongs end?

Yes.

It kind of is, it just isn't based on race.

&gt;Why? Why does using race as the criteria make the outlay punitive when other criteria isn’t?

I think taxation hurts the people who are paying taxes, which is why the government needs to choose its policies carefully so that what it spends money on provides a net benefit to the taxpayers.  Ideally government expenditures would provide for the national defense, or combat crime, or provide healthcare in a cost effective manner, or improve the economy, etc.

If tax dollars are used to provide health care and I am healthy I could at least potentially benefit from my taxes when I get sick one day.  If tax dollars are used to improve the state of the economy I could potentially benefit by getting a job I might not have obtained otherwise or by increasing my business's sales.  If tax dollars are used for scientific research I could potentially benefit from any resultant scientific advance.  If tax dollars are used for the military I could benefit from being safe.

I said CLOSE the RACIAL WEALTH GAP. I don't understand what's happening. I'm being very specific and it's almost as if you can't comprehend unless I repeat my position over. 

The logistics on how to a reparations policy has already been mapped out by economists Dr. William Darity in his book From Here to Equality. Every detail has been covered.

There is a racial wealth gap between white and black Americans that is about an $800,000 difference. Closing that gap would be a little over $600,000 each. That would be enough to buy a nice home and exit poverty.

Almost every community faces some or other form of discrimination from others. So, if you are talking about just discrimination, then you cannot highlight only black folks as victims. Furthermore, you cannot propose solution that takes money from non-black Americans (including many races/ethnicities that played little to no part in slavery) for black Americans. 

The problem is that you are not only talking about only black related issues (slavery), but also about discrimination that affects others as well.

Here's what I obtained on the first hit:

*prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership of a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.*

*the belief that different races possess distinct characteristics, abilities, or qualities, especially so as to distinguish them as inferior or superior to one another.*

That seems fairly close in terms of abstract concept to Rand's definition.  So what do you take issue with in regards to how Rand defined it?

&gt;Group C is the responsible party and that would be the government that allowed the violation of black citizens'rights. The American government never died and the American government will pay reparations like it has done for other groups.

The American government has changed dramatically over time and most importantly the people it represents who fund it have changed.  People from 150 years ago are long since dead as are any of the politicians that composed it.  The government even fought a long and expensive war against rebel factions to enforce changes it had made.  It's really not the same government any longer.  The people who fund and manage the government are completely different.

&gt;By having an economist determined the damages which has been done multiple times already.

If the basic premise is flawed (aka racism), it doesn't matter how many ""economists"" attempt quantification.  If individuals alive today can demonstrate that they have been specifically damaged unjustly in a quantifiable manner, I'd be in favor of the government paying their damages.  But that's the problem; it's being based on racial group identity and not on individual grievances.  If someone was wrongfully imprisoned or overtaxed, then by all means I'm in favor of compensation.

Also, while considering ""damages"" we also need to contemplate ""benefits"".  If we go back far enough we might have to look at how descendants of slaves are doing in the United States relative to how they would have fared had the slaves been left in  Africa.  Some may have had their ancestors enslaved by other Africans or their ancestors could have been killed in tribal warfare, or they could have died from Malaria or other illnesses that could have been prevented with American medicine and sanitation, etc.

&gt;&gt;It could be argued that many descendants of slaves are better off living in the United States today and have a better life here than they would have had in Africa. How do we account for that?
&gt;
&gt;No that can't be argued at all because that's silly. Black Americans live in third world conditions within America right now... lol.

Black Americans are not monolithic.  Some live in poor conditions as do many white people.  Some may have made poor decisions and damaged themselves as have many white people.  Many also enjoy first world conditions and have benefited tremendously from being here relative to how they would have fared in Africa, and many of those who are poor still have more opportunity than they would have had in many if not most African countries.

There's a reason people want to leave Africa and come to the United States and not the other way around.  However, if anyone feels they would be better off in Africa, I would be in favor of having the government foot one-way first class tickets in exchange for someone renouncing their U.S. citizenship.

&gt;I am referring to the reparations that the American government paid to the families of lynching victims. Don't worry, I see you dodging that fact because you don't have a way to rebuttal.

However, it is simplistic to blame this level of wealth gap soley on a lower starting point - or at least concluding that a massive transfer of wealth will result in this situation stabilizing.

Currently, African Americans suffer from [downward inter-generational mobility](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/race_paper.pdf) (an issue shared with Native Americans, but not shared with Whites, Hispanics or Asians) -- unless a wealth transfer fixes this issue (and you could argue it might help), the wealth discrepancy would just re-emerge after a couple generations.

And this isn't solely post 1965 immigration selection (#9).  An interesting case study of this is analyzing two highly racially targeted groups (Asians and Black people in California pre-WW2) - and it turned out Asians (again the CA born ones) emerged post civil rights era with much more [upward mobility](https://www.nber.org/papers/w22748.pdf).
