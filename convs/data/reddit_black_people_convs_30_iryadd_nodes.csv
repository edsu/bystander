Following a years-long series of extreme wildland fire seasons, 2020 has been one of Canada’s quietist since the 1990s.

This is going to happen next year under the current leadership.

Commiefornia lacks proper land managment. Blame the dirty hippies.

And apparently antifa had a hand in this.

We all know that cops hunt black people as a matter of course.  

NYT and LeBron James said so:

Well, I’m black and grew up in the ghetto. My current neighborhood literally has one white person living here. None of us, none of my family, none of my neighbors have been hunted by the police. We’ve met racist cops, but we’ve met far more fair and minority cops than racist or even white. I’ve also dealt with racist teachers, coworkers, and store clerks... none of them have “hunted” me or any black people I know... and I’ve met far more kind and open-minded people than racist people in this country. 

I guess they only hunt black people where you live.",-0.9165

Last time someone made a comment like that, I thought it was a joke.. then, he ended up going off on me because he was serious as all hell. In the end, we ended up having it out because I basically had a white man trying to tell me that I’m not only oppressed, but I don’t know that I’m oppressed.

It’s comforting that you were joking because there are actually people who think this way, and that deeply fucking concerns me. 

I’m sorry about that!",-0.4432
