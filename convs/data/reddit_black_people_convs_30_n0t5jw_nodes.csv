Anyone can be a police officer 

The US has some crazy racist people that, yes, do just want to kill people for being anything besides white. Then specifically there is the racist white culture surrounding black people.

So yes in most of these cases, the intent is to have some reason to get an excuse to hurt/harm people just for being black.",-0.8522

No excuse. I’m not familiar with the way police work in the US. I’m trying to understand if police just go around killing people for absolutely no reason. 

In the past we’ve seen a lot of police killing black people. Were the people killed doing something to provoke the police? If they actually said nothing and put their hands up would they have been killed? I mean, are cops just stopping these people with the intent on killing them even before stopping them? EVEN if they were provoking and being rude to the cops it shouldn’t matter, no bullets should have been shot.",-0.9932
