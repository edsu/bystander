First, gentrification and desegregation are different things. This should be blatantly obvious to anyone who isn't carelessly conflating class and ethnicity. 

Second, investment can come from publically funded initiatives aimed at improving facilities and services available to communities, and empowering and enabling members of those communities to play a part in the social and economic improvement and maintenance of their community. Property speculation is not he only means of ""enriching"" an area. 

Third, you seem to be more concerned with improving an area code than a community. A community is comprised of its members, not hectares of land. You are describing essentially an increase in land and property value. That does not benefit the residents of poorer communities which are already disproportionately more likely to be renters. It benefits property speculators, generally individuals and pension funds that are not members of the communities. 

Fourth, you seem to think that gentrification just stops at some reasonable point where it's *just* desegregated enough, rather than continuing to drive working class people of all ethnicities out of the area, generally into increasingly underserviced and socioeconomically deprived geographic areas.

Gentrification may provide a new tax base, but it also reshapes what  cities are, turning them into explicit supporters of inequality, reliant  on it to self-fund, yet still unable to meet the needs of their poor.

In America, schools are funded by districts, typically aligning with each Zip Code. These districts are funded by .... *property taxes*. So, increasing property taxes within a zip code directly improves the educational opportunities for the members of that community, which in turn is directly tied to the economic opportunities for the members of that community. With better schools and more jobs in the neighborhood, crime rates go down -- leading to further enrichment of the community.

The reality is, the American poor would be better off distributed across the country in communities that *could* support their needs; *Communities with proportional class representation.*

I fully agree. I disagree that gentrification would allow them proportionate space within a given area, rather than being driven out of their communities and into even worse ones with even lower property taxes and even lower rents. At least until the venture capitalists and property speculators start eyeing those neighbourhoods up too.

A 2019 NYU study showed ""no evidence of elevated rates of mobility for kids who are born into gentrifying neighborhoods"".

Another by the Philly Fed and University of Chicago, showed:

&gt;**There are very small differences in out-migration rates between  gentrifying neighborhoods and otherwise similar neighborhoods that don’t  gentrify**. Over ten years, we would expect about 60 percent of less  educated renters to move out of non-gentrifying low income  neighborhoods, compared to about 66 percent of less educated renters in  gentrifying neighborhoods.  
&gt;  
&gt;Those who leave gentrifying neighborhoods do not end up moving to  destination neighborhoods that are measurably worse than the destination  neighborhoods of households moving out of poor but not gentrifying  neighborhoods  
&gt;  
&gt;**The demographic composition of gentrifying neighborhoods,  post-gentrification, remains highly mixed, with many less educated  renters and homeowners**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Less educated renters that remain in gentrifying neighborhood don’t  see significant increases in rents:**  There’s no appreciable difference  in rent increases between less educated living in gentrifying and  non-gentrifying neighborhoods

&gt;**Demographic changes in gentrifying neighborhoods are those that are  generally associated with better outcomes for low income children**  growing up in these neighborhoods.

It is, the same political party in the States that fought for slavery, implemented the policies leading to redlining, and now fights to stop the redevelopment of predominately black communities.

Redlining promptly resulted in disruption of normal neighborhood life-cycles and prevented development in these poorer communities.

I'm not stating that gentrification and desegregation are the same process, but that in America, poverty trends can be traced along racial lines; There is an overwhelming relationship between poverty and race in the US.

With the affect redlining had on neighborhood development, those neighborhoods account for a vast % of impoverished blacks in America -- and score worst on the diversity index -- they are segregated communities. For these communities, in America, gentrification *is* a question of desegregation.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*\[...\] it also frequently kills some cultural traditions and diversity, the precise characteristics that make cities so dynamic and desirable in the first place.*

&gt;*Gentrification may provide a new tax base, but it also reshapes what   cities are, turning them into explicit supporters of inequality, reliant   on it to self-fund, yet still unable to meet the needs of their poor.*

Notice a key tenet Merkowitz's argument: killing cultural traditions and diversity, reshaping the cities...

These neighborhoods are NOT diverse, they have some of the worst diversity index scores; He simply means it ceases to be a black enclave -- too many white people.

You assert that gentrification drives out the old residents of a neighborhood -- same argument in a sense, but not focused on race. You also assert it drives up rent costs (which you deem to be a major factor in driving people out).

For your fears on gentrification:

[https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2019/wp19-30.pdf](https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2019/wp19-30.pdf)

Rent increases for gentrifying neighborhoods increase at a slower rate than non gentrifying. Further, an NYU study also corroborates: ""Gentrification"" of an area doesn't drive residents out of their neighborhoods any faster than what happens in non-gentrifying neighborhoods.

In reality, the oppositions you and Merkowitz levy aren't based in fact.

&gt;I think you're exhibiting a combination of naivete and magical thinking  that is typical of ideologues and particularly of those of libertarian  stripes, which is not amenable to scientific thinking.

My ""magic"" thinking, is what actually happened everywhere else. Communities grew, stabilized, declined, and were renewed to start the process over -- all driven by market forces. The only place that broke down? Where the government initiated red-lining.
