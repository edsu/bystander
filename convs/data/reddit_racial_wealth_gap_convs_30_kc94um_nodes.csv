The difficulty is that it is easy to avoid the tax if the parameters are known, making it more ineffective (hence why one-off works, annual doesn't).

Nobody is wanting to maintain any elements of a status quo that systematically denies equal access to 'tools' to develop wealth.  If you can point to a policy today that systematically denies equal access to something for people based on race, then I'll oppose that with you.

However, seeking to proactively modify the distribution of wealth in order to achieve a specific outcome by race, is, uh, not that.

The unfortunate bit about the truly liberal approach to correcting the racial injustice of the past is that - if implemented correctly - it will take a few generations for random chance alone to 'mix' populations from initial conditions where they are by some measure 'separate'.  Going the other way - committing what are effectively mild racial injustices (e.g. affirmative action policy) - is said to speed up that process but at the cost of completely discarding the principle ""equality under the law"".  The other issue is that it's hard to identify an endpoint for those policies -- they will always seek to change the distribution of wealth/opportunity/success so long as the world falls short of a hypothetical ideal (e.g. exactly zero mutual information between race and some set of outcomes).  Further what if there's a third, hidden variable, which causes disparate outcomes correlated with race?

Why does it matter who I am?  Is there an ideological test you need people to pass to listen to their arguments?

&gt;This is why I don’t waste my time trying to have discussions with people who clearly don’t understand what the majority of people are going through.

This is pretty patronizing.  I've been poor, I've been rich, rich is better but I still very much remember being poor.  Does that pass your ideological purity test?  Probably not, because you are the one who can't put yourself in someone else's shoes here.

&gt;You can keep pretending it’s a giant coincidence that millennials can’t afford homes, and most people don’t have enough in their savings to cover a $400 emergency while Bezos’s wealth skyrockets to hundreds of billions. Unfortunately you’re wrong. The system isn’t working for most people.

Housing is expensive for reasons that have little or nothing to do with Mr. Bezos.  Specifically governments making it almost impossible to build new housing in places where people want it combined with artificially low interest rates (which admittedly are also correlated with some of the wealth bubble we are seeing).

What's your reason why they can't afford homes?  Because Bezos somehow stole their money?  That doesn't pass the sniff test compared to the other factors I've mentioned.

Modern Conservatives in the usa do enough dehumanizing of themselves already lol

Nope. I was just suggesting one of the many solutions to the 'oh no, the rich guy left!' issue. Its what my hometown did when the owner of the factory closed up shop and left. The town bought the factory and continued to produce the same products under a new name, since all the machines were left behind for sale when the owners left.

&gt;Either way the point is that it won’t redistribute anything because others will just come and take over.

This is a *very very* fair concern. Pretty much all of what you said are fair things to plan for. If we raise tax on the rich folk and they leave, then have the communities they abandon run the abandoned businesses, we would certainly need to have some kind of check/balance on this system to prevent the same old issue from arising. 

&gt;Instead of [...] why not [...] ?

Well, Im not proposing we kick out the rich folk. Id like people to pay a bigger share when they use more public resources such as in their cases, but wont cry if they decide to leave rather than pay whats fair. I dont think Higher Taxation for more use is 'taking money from those who are already successful' either, as their success would not be possible without the public supporting them in hundreds of ways. 

That being said, I agree that ""Increasing minimum wage, making education free etc."" are cornerstone parts of a good, healthy society.

gfqhldr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/kc94um/closing_the_racial_wealth_gap_requires_heavy/gfqhldr/,LiberalTerryN,"Yeah, I think a substantial portion of the racial wealth gap is attributable to both historical and current forms of discrimination preventing black Americans from accumulating wealth or the means to earn high incomes:

* Private discrimination preventing ownership of homes, depressing property values in black neighborhoods, preventing equal access to business credit for building profitable businesses, preventing black-owned businesses from having the same level of success, systematically lower pay, access to training/mentorship/apprenticeships, etc.
* Government discrimination preventing access to similar quality education at either the K-12 level or university/professional educations, reducing access to credit or insurance for homeownership, enforcing Jim Crow, redlining neighborhoods to effectively endorse private economic discrimination, etc.

Meanwhile, a shift towards a winner-take-all economy (weakening not only labor's bargaining power against management/ownership, but also small businesses against big businesses, local businesses versus national/global players, even small investors versus big investors), has baked in past economic winners into consolidation of wealth and power, so that the unequal starting position is perpetuated, and even intensified over the past few decades.

So the solution might be to give labor and smaller investors and smaller businesses a fighting chance, in a competitive environment where a thumb on the scale in favor of the smaller players is effectively a drag on the bigger players. The big problem, though, is that proposals designed to even the playing field (e.g., reducing the regressive economic drag of high prices in healthcare, housing, and education) are often met with hand-wringing about how we're gonna pay for all of this. So taxation has to be part of the equation, and progressive taxation is the most economically efficient way to meet particular revenue targets.

It's all interconnected (race-conscious social/economic/political forces and race-neutral forces, private social/economic forces and public policy, distribution of wealth, racial justice, taxation of wealth, etc.).

Most of that wealth is potential wealth — the value that is currently placed in the shares of the companies they own, not money in the bank or physical assets. Play out the scenario where the rich must sell off 10% of their assets each year to pay the tax. So 10% of he shares go on the market. First of all that will drive down share value, making “wealth” vanish without benefiting anyone. Second, someone has to buy those shares, which diverts investments from other potential uses, resulting in a net drop of investment in corporations, which like results in a drop in productivity and stagnation of wages. Every single year. Then, what does the Government do with these taxes? They could put it into social security building retirement wealth, but that’s a non-transferable wealth that won’t necessarily benefit the next generation. You could just give cash benefits but that will likely be spent,  not kept as wealth. The Government could instead by shares and give them to citizens, but will they keep them or turn around and sell them, again not increasing wealth. 

And all this will be controlled by a government which has a poor record in such regards. Take social security for instance — how much better would the trust fund be if it had been professionally managed instead of going to the general funds and getting meager returns since its inception.

&gt; Finally, a capital gains tax, like nearly all of the federal tax code, is a tax on future consumption. Future personal consumption, in the form of savings, is taxed, while present consumption is not. By favoring present over future consumption, savings are discouraged, which decreases future available capital and lowers long term growth.

It's essentially the equivalent of assaulting a person and putting them in a wheel chair and then saying ""Sorry."" and that's supposed to make it ok.

Blacks in the US have literally faced generations of systemic oppression and no one, wants to actually right that wrong. They want to hide behind ""Well, \*I\* wasn't responsible. So you're just going to have to get over it and work like the rest of us!""

Equality, Equity and Justice don't exist in American society because they refuse to be self aware enough to take responsibility culturally for the crimes of the state and their society. They don't want to right those wrongs. They prefer it continue.

Because they legitimately believe, that an individual's effort leads to an individual's success. This is the American Dream in a nutshell... Work hard, earn great wealth. But they also believe the anti-myth. If you're poor, then it means you haven't worked hard and this is why they oppose change and justice for communities of color and the poor. Because they believe those communities deserve those circumstances. Go to the places where many Conservatives go. Alex Jones, QAnon, YouTube conservatism. Follow those channels. They consistently make the argument that there's a ""flaw"" in the ""Black Character"" that doesn't allow Blacks in the US to achieve success. This is their framing and a LOT of people buy into it, they're wrong, and white supremacists... but it's something many people deep down believe. That ""Black Society"" is somehow inferior... and that's REALLY why there's poverty there. Because the American Dream Anti-Myth tell them so.

Like all such programs, the motivations were good, the implementation and results were disastrous for the entire economy, especially for the many families that refinanced their homes for some quick cash.

&gt;it would be arounud 130bn a year. So that is not enough to address the wealth gap in a single year, but if you keep it up for a long period of time, I would be surprised if it didn't have an impact. 

I think it would have the effect of reducing stock market returns for normal people in a way that would make it by far a net loss.

The time factor in investment results in significant changes to effective capital gains tax rates. Let me do a bit of napkin math here to illustrate. Suppose you have a $10k investment that makes 5% returns in a 2% inflation environment, and you hold that investment for 10 years. It's now worth $16288, and your real return is $4099. However, your income for the purpose of capital gains taxation is $6288. As a result, a 20% nominal capital gains tax would be a 30.6% real capital gains tax on this particular investment.

Taxes on ordinary income don't have this problem, because taxes are collected in the same year. There is technically some inflation between paycheck day and tax day, but it's de minimis.

&gt;I do pay income taxes on current consumption so that's completely nonsense

You don't pay income taxes on current consumption. Whether you consume more or less is irrelevant to your income tax exposure.

Don’t you think that election results—whose fundamental purpose is to form a government with an ideology the population wants and actually voted for, is a lot more representative, accurate, and valid than a random poll from 6 years ago?

The catch is, because of the differences in languages, the question was mistranslated and had a different meaning in Czech, substantially skewing the results.


Back to the point- polls like these are rarely accurate. The one you just linked comes up again and again when privileged Americans talk about how great communism is and lecture those who are directly impacted by it (no offense to you personally, just a general observation) Most of the links in the post are not actually working and the account that posted it is suspicious at best with -50 karma and constant posts of propaganda. Since you linked the post, you might as well read all the comments underneath it with valid criticisms and people calling it out for its bs.

&gt; &gt; Heavy progressive taxation directly reduces the racial disparity of wealth because it reduces the highly concentrated wealth that is held almost exclusively by white people.

Yes, that's what I'm talking about, too. Reducing the ability of those who are already rich and powerful to perpetuate that wealth and power by consolidating and acquiring an even bigger chunk of the pie is an important part of building up the bottom, too. They're directly related, because giving the people at the bottom or the middle sufficient bargaining power to be able to hold their own against their richest and most powerful competitors means inherently limiting the (relative) power of the people already at the top.

That mechanism is race-neutral on its face, but because the disparate impact of the status quo disproportionately limits the ability of the poor and middle class to become rich, targeting that mechanism will have the effect of reversing some of that disparate impact (thereby becoming a disparate impact the other way).",0.9611

This includes but not limited to better funded primary and secondary education, UBI, universal health care, paid parental leave(available to be split between both parents), **END TO BAILING OUT FAILED CORPORATIONS** etc. That is how Scandinavian countries have been able to create wealth and increase equality across all their inhabitants, citizens and immigrants alike. I literally wrote an 5 page paper on this the other day so some arguments are pretty fresh in my head. There's some limits to how fast and how far we can adapt these programs because Americans are still taught to believe that social problems are individual problems and the ""rugged individual"" at least to some extent.

There is still the argument that the US is too big but that and other common (legitimate) arguments against a system more like Nordic countries can be shut down fairly easily by the fact that we had many of these programs during the great depression and some are still around. Medicare, Medicaid, socialized medicine for government officials and military still exists and are very popular.  Using our size and diversity as an excuse is a lazy cop-out especially since we won't even try.

I feel like a broken record: you enact policy that successfully benefits the impoverished population at large, you will disproportionately help blacks and Hispanics.

&gt;Correct, not all of x race is in y place. My point was that there is a difference in the cost of the poverty. The most expensive poverty comes from the city which has a much higher amount of minority populous.

Right.  And I understand the tactics would be different depending on environment.

 I'm assuming that the idea is to focus on the biggest cost sink, give it a small area to monitor, then an ideology to back it. If you just say ""reduce poverty"" it gives no one a call to action. It's why in this ""just a nickel a day would feed Paul"" commercials it includes the place, the housing situation, the children and the circumstances they are in. Not just ""we got hungry people in Africa""

Let me do a bit of napkin math here to illustrate. Suppose you have a $10k investment that makes 5% returns in a 2% inflation environment, and you hold that investment for 10 years. It's now worth $16288, and your real return is $4099. However, your income for the purpose of capital gains taxation is $6288. As a result, a 20% nominal capital gains tax would be a 30.6% real capital gains tax on this particular investment.

Taxes on ordinary income don't have this problem, because taxes are collected in the same year. There is technically some inflation between paycheck day and tax day, but it's de minimis.

I understand all that but I'm not sure TVM should be a huge consideration from a tax perspective.

&gt; You don't pay income taxes on current consumption. Whether you consume more or less is irrelevant to your income tax exposure.

Income taxes still exist. Am I missing something here? As i earn my salary uncle sam gets his cut dollar for dollar. On top of sales taxes? Are you saying this because all income dollars will be taxed independent of whether or not they are invested (excluding 401k)

Of course, you did say 'wealth' not income, but typically you tax flows (income) not stocks (wealth).

Of state and local taxes:

* income taxes are progressive

* Property taxes are *technically* somewhat regressive, but that's from a really narrow perspective (two homeowners with same house value but different income).

* Sales taxes are regressive.

If you sell investments less than a calendar year after buying them, you pay regular income tax.

Can you explain to me what you're talking about?

If you're wondering why capital gains *in general* are taxed less than income:

* it's double taxation (you already pay income taxes on the money before you get it)

* it's not indexed for inflation (you still pay capital gains taxes on zero real-rate-of-return investments)

* taxing capital gains decreases the savings rate (in the long run a higher savings rate yields higher economic growth)

What would high capital gains taxes do?  Borrowing would become more expensive, short-term consumption (perhaps of luxury goods) would increase, and in the long run everyone would be poorer, all things being equal.  Theoretically, I think it can be argued that the optimal capital gains tax is zero.

Capital gains tax is a double tax, which was ~49% of his income.

Dividends are also double taxed, 27%.

He had $450,470 of business income, which I imagine was regular income, up to 35% tax (3.2% of his income).

The last 21% of his income was taxable interest, taxed as regular income up to 35%.

And of course, he gave 30% of his income to charity, which doesn't get taxed and doesn't count as income.

The 13% figure is totally dishonest since more than 75% of his income is subject to double taxation and 30% of his income was given away.  I don't really want to do the math on all of this, but accounting for charitable contributions only (ignoring the fact that he still got taxed on some of it) takes the marginal rate up to 18.5%.

You might think double taxation is zombie accounting but take a minute and ask yourself if the person who pays the cigarette tax changes if the tax is calculated at the register and paid by the consumer or if the tax is paid for by the seller and added to the sticker price.  In the same way, when a company pays a dividend to a person they pay tax on that money as ordinary income (in 2011, a 39% rate) and then that pile of cash is taxed a *second* time when it changes hands.  Of course, who really walks home at the end of the day with less money depends on elasticities, but if anything that highlights the major problem with corporate income taxes - the incidence is highly variable and non-transparent (you could claim that the 39% income tax paid on the dividend came out of the paycheck of janitors just as easily as someone else can claim it reduced the size of dividends).

&gt; As for the ""optimal"" capital gains? Same as income. What are investors going to do, NOT INVEST? They're not idiots.

Well, I think I was talking about the savings rate (more generally than 'investors').

Potentially, but it’s not an obvious given. Just society can exist without equity of outcomes. 

If you force everyone back to stone age to live in caves, you will have perfect equity, but other than satisfying your eat-the-rich boner, it doesn’t make anyone better off. 

Practically speaking, too much inqueality is bad, because it leads to market inefficiencies and some social unrest, but if you can control for both, inequality is absolutely a neutral concept and there is nothing inherently bad about some people being unimaginably rich. The goal should be creating most prosperous society, which is a different approach than animalistic gut feeling of jealousy of somebody else having more.

Percentages is just an efficient and fair approach to raise taxes, but if flat tax could generate same funds with no negative externalities, it would work just as well. 

What matters is how much money you are raising and who’s paying it. The various small prints of how exactly those taxes are generated is just details. 

At high level, we, as a society, are extracting nearly all our taxes *exclusively* from the rich, with bottom 90% of citizens and 100% corporations paying a nearly insignificant amount. And you’re arguing here, they should pay even more yet, when they already pay for nearly all of it. Okay, I don’t object to raising taxes, but there should be a better reason why it’s needed than your personal hate for those better off than you.
