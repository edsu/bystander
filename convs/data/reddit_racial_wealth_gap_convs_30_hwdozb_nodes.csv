How do you think property is bought? You'd need some outside capital to supply that - even if the rent goes to a landlord, the landlord pays back a mortgage to a bank. We can talk about the discrimination and how to fix things like credit systems - but the funds will still be flowing outside the community (it just passes from the landlord into the bank that issued the loan).   


But regardless - getting a loan to buy property you can't afford does not necessarily build wealth. Creating a gap between income and spending is what gives you surplus money (which if invested - in real estate, equities elsewhere) builds wealth.  


So when we talk about fixing structural inequality we should be focused on that specific equation - what makes it impossible to create a gap between income and spending. Some of it does come down to financial education, and some of it also comes down to inherent inequalities.",0.8951

Not only that but using home equity to leverage a 2nd rental property is a great way to build passive income too. Equities are also great investments no doubt about that but anyone who bought US real estate towards their bottom in 2011 and 2012 is doing very very well right now.",0.9773

Yeah, some individuals will overcome these circumstances but by and large a lot won’t, and many will miss out on opportunities to further their career. A good amount of time is spent playing catch up. 

You are projecting that under resourced communities are going to produce the same results as adequately funded and developed communities because you think it’s up to each individual to dictate their destiny, but discount the compounding factors these individuals as a group face comparatively.
