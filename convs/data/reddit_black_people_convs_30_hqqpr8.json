And BLM isn't about superiority, it's about parity.\n\nThe phrase \"black lives matter\" is a tragic affirmation of a reality that *should* be self-evident and a complaint about a culture that seems willing to ignore the corrosive effects of structural racism whether in general, or in the specific context of police brutality.\n\nAnd while it's absolutely true that the police aren't responsible for structural racism- though some of them [helped build the structures](https://time.com/4779112/police-history-origins/)- they receive focus because the murder of a specific black person by a specific police officer is shocking, immediate, and relatable in a way that a broader discussion of say, [redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining), is not.",
