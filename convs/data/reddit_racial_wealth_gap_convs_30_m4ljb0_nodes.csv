Also, calling them ""race neutral"" is largely not true since 1) they are specifically chosen to help one race out in particular, and 2) some of them would absolutely have a disproportionately negative effect on other races, such as through higher taxes.  I have absolutely no doubt that the ACLU and other left-wing groups would jump all over such ""race neutral"" laws and call them racist if their benefits and costs were reversed.",-0.7486

I see it as proof Thomas’ theory is paying off, he finally has a listener on the bench, he wasn’t speaking to empty air, P&amp;I is on the upswing, now at 200% the original value! 

You see it for the jurisprudential part, and I find that intriguing. Are you reading the clear majority, after all it was 7(1,1)-0, as tea leaves that a test will soon emerge with a ruleset once the right case, something close to call maybe a 5-4/6-3, shows up? I find the lack of a ruleset to be the reason this case is practically useless for marking purposes, sure grisswold opened the door but Roe (Casey) was the landmark.

After all, the War on Poverty has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that signing poor people checks does not solve poverty.

They first attempt to argue that President Biden should forgive $50,000 of student loan debt, because they claim that the student loan system ""is racist and predatory"". Yet who would actually benefiting from forgiving that much worth of student loan debt? It would do nothing to help the vast majority of poor people, black and white, who have not attended college. It doesn't even give much help to people who attended your average college. Rather, it benefits doctors and lawyers, and other professionals who took on over $50,000 worth of student loans. These are the very people who need help the least. According to a [recent University of Chicago study](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BFI_WP_2020169.pdf), the top 10% of income earners would see seven times more benefits from such a plan than the bottom 10%. Considering that the stated goal of this program is to lower the racial income gap, it appears to fail marvelously.

Their second solution is turning the post office into a bank, which they claim would save black families $3,000 a year. I have severe doubts that the US Postal Service would be able to run a profitable bank. Hell, they can't even break even running post offices, and they've had over two centuries of experience on that front.

Finally, they argue that the Child Tax Credit should be radically expanded to fight poverty. If anything, this would be harmful for black children, as well as white children, because it adds to the incentives to have children out of wedlock.

I share your concern for the lack of wealth in certain communities, but the ACLU ignores ideas that would actually make a difference. If they really wanted to make a difference, then they would be advocating for high marriage rates, charter and other alternative schools, and regulatory policies that promote job growth. The problems in the black community today, as well as the white community, can be best solved by promoting marriage. Every piece of evidence has shown that whether of not your parents are married and living together is the number one determinant of your financial outcome in life.",0.7448

Their solutions are entirely policy proposals, which lie with the legislature and executive branch. Their proposed solutions are incredibly dumb. Their first solution primarily benefits well educated professionals, their second is a recipe for incompetence, and their third will further dis-incentivize marriage, which hurts children the most.

You seem to find it landmark on the basis of the jurisprudence itself, in that it’s incorporated. Done so strongly, 7 majority, 1 concurrence, 1 other concurrence. That said, there was no ruleset created, merely it applies, so I am asking how you see this as landmark without any real meat yet.
