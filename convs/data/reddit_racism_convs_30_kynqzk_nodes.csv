I would simply recommend using a different breeder. You want someone that makes you feel comfortable and has clearly cared well for the puppies. I‚Äôm not a POC so can‚Äôt say anything about the commonality of dealing with racism in searching for a dog, but I wish you the best of luck and hope you find the Dobie of your dreams from a breeder that treats you with respect! Good luck!",0.9905
gjhzori,https://www.reddit.com/r/DobermanPinscher/comments/kynqzk/breeder_racism/gjhzori/,JessicaRabbit_001,"Look for another breeder. If this breeder considers dobermans to be ‚Äúfighting‚Äù dogs, they are not qualified to breed them.  When I sold my pups, many years ago the only thing I insisted on was that if you were a renter, your landlord accepted the breed and any  pet fee was paid before pick up. I also followed up on the pups and the new owner and made myself available to answer questions. Good luck, be prepared to be put on a list for a well bred pup.",0.875

Im not a POC so I cant speak to it but the breeder was great to work with and breeds amazing dobes. I got my boy in June and couldnt be happier. He is very cautious in general about who he gives pups too and is a very upfront no BS person so be prepared for that but its close to you and the dogs have a great temprament.,0.9238

A top notch breeder will be more concerned about placing their well cared for pups in a home where the personality of the pup will mesh well with yours/your family. Good luck in finding a more qualified breeder and hope you are able to find a doberbaby.,0.9141
gjmynsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DobermanPinscher/comments/kynqzk/breeder_racism/gjmynsw/,MantisStyle,"Maybe racist, maybe not. That one breeder sounds like she's got a fucked up bias, but who knows. If it is any consolation, many many (most, all) breeders are a bit wacky. We have been denied because we had a child. We have been denied because we never owned a doberman before (chicken or the egg situation). We were denied because we didn't want to crop the ears. We work from home (pre covid) with a yard, great salary, and we both are very athletic - an ideal home for a doberman. And we're white. And we were denied by several breeders. 

So is it a race thing? Absolutely could be. But it could be a simple as the fact that you're in an apartment (we were denied for that too, even though the apartments butted up against Piedmont park in Atlanta (akin to Central Park). Like I said, breeders are all crazy in their own way. But they all want to avoid two things: returned dogs that they will have to place later or people breeding their dogs without additional payment/approval. It is what it is. So even if you are being discriminated against, be happy that you're not supporting them with your hard earned money. 

There's plenty of breeders out there. Don't worry - you'll find one. Also remember that we're still in lockdown so the demand for dogs have gone way way up.  So they can be as picky as they want. A friend of mine couldn't get approved for an unwanted pound mixed-breed dog that was most likely going to be put down. All because he doesn't have a yard. After 9 months of trying he finally found one - a pure bred puppy from a breeder. Go figure. 

But I wouldn't say there's any more or less racism in doberman dog breeding than you would find in any other walk of life. And remember, you don't have to get one from NY. It really can be from anywhere. Good luck!",-0.8607

There is a wonderful breeder/AKC judge down in the south ,his kennel name is Talladega. He is black. You might want to talk with him about his experiences.

There‚Äôs Also a very sweet AA breeder in The Midwest, IL or Michigan who has some very well known dogs. Her kennel ame is Moa‚Äôs.",0.931
