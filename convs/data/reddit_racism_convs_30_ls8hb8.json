      "text": "Hello! Once again, back with another anoying rant haha. This time it is more serious. There is a *lot* more racism than you might think. If you are unfamiliar with this topic, let me explain. Racism is when somebody is bulling/treating someone unfairly just because of where they are from, their cultures, beliefs and also skin tone. You might have heard of black lives matter. That rant is for another day. However, there's a big problem with racism to Asian people, especially in royale high. It's not as well known, and that will also be an important thing to know when listening to my story. Let's begin...\n\nThis is of course, a true story (as you can probably guess). The story will be about my friend. There is another story, about me, but that's a story for another day. Anyways, my friend at the time had a black and white aesthetic at that time, and her name was in Japanese, because she is, like me, a Japanese person. Her name translates to \"Michiru\". Of course, you may recognise these features to be your stereotypical \"smol bean\". This is very important to the story. We began to enter the trading hub, which was very exciting because it was Michiru's first time going to the trading hub! That's when Michiru did her first trade. Because she had never been in the hub before, she didn't know values at all, so when she offered her cottage princess skirt for this lady's parasol, she was spammed with hurtful messages, calling her a \"smol bean\". She is my irl friend, so she texted me some screenshots, showing me their chat inside the trade box. She was Japanese so her grammar was quite bad, which this girl spread rumors about, saying she was doing it to try and be \"cute\". The server went mad. Everyone was doing what they do here, the jokes, the laughs, everyone was acting like she was a sight to see at a comedy show, when she is a real person who *has feelings*! My friend left the trading hub crying. The words some of these people said were stuff like:\n\n\u2022\"LOL a smol bean\"-\n\n\u2022\"Bruh-\"\n\n\u2022\"Lol her name is in Chinese so she can seem cute xDD\".\n\n\u2022\"I hope both sides of your pillow are warm \u263a\ufe0f\"\n\nShe has never played royale high since.\n\n Please don't be rude just because someone has a black and white aesthetic, or because, someone speaks Japanese. Please don't be rude because someone doesn't speak the same language as you. And please, for the love of God, please DO NOT be racist.\n\nStay safe, everyone.",
