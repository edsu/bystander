I\u2019m from Colorado and my high school was kinda famous for the athletic programs and so there were like 4 visibly overweight people in my whole school. Then I come to art school in the south and MANY of my classmates are really fat! I was not expecting that so being a bit culture shocked I was a bit too formal to most overweight girls I met and they took my niceness for either me hitting on them or trying to become instant bffs. Honestly I feel bad for some of the girls that I befriended early on and then had to tell I wasn\u2019t into after they asked me to be gfs. Many where really nice and honestly just fat because they had been through a lot in life and had bad relationships with food.

Like another famous Japanese hero, Sailor Moon. Anime art typically uses a variety of colours for hair, eyes and skin, that do not align with real life races. Midoriya is green haired lol. So anime characters may well have dark/black skin whilst still being Japanese, if that is their character.",
