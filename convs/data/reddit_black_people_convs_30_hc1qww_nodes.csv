But off the top of my head, I can recommend his interview with Larry Elder. He challenges the general racism narrative very insightfully.

Also his Jordan Peterson interviews are incredibly powerful stuff. He has spent decades studying what causes people to become so unreasonable and extremist.

edit: that actually happened btw. along with several other arrests. im ok with second chances in life, i really am, but after that you are considered a low life in my book. and people say ""but he was getting his life back together"".. shut up, he was under the influence of fentanyl and methamphetamine during his arrest. the media wont show you the ""whole video"" either because it doesnt fit their narrative.. he WAS resisting right after he threw a baggy containing a white substance on the ground.. smh",-0.8992

Maybe Floyd isn‚Äôt the best martyr for this movement it he still didn‚Äôt deserve what happened to him and that‚Äôs the principle of this movement. You shouldn‚Äôt have to be anything in order to not be murdered by police
