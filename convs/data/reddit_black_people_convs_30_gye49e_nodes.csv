No, because again that is a question about the beliefs of individuals.

No, because again this is a question about the beliefs or actions of individuals.

So what does it mean when people say that all cops are bastards (ACAB) or jn this case, the American police state is ""toxic""?

If it were an individual thing, you'd give them the benefit of the doubt, but it isn't; it's an institutional thing. the job itself is a bastard, therefore by carrying out the job, they are bastards. To take it to an extreme: there were no good members of the gestapo because there was no way to carry out the directives of the gestapo and to be a good person. it is the same with the american police state. [Police do not exist to protect and serve, according to the US supreme court itself](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/28/politics/justices-rule-police-do-not-have-a-constitutional-duty-to-protect.html), but to dominate, control, and terrorize in order to maintain the interests of state and capital.

Who are the good cops then? The ones who either quit or are fired for refusing to do the job.

While the following list focuses on the US as a model police state, ALL cops in ALL countries are derivative from very similar violent traditions of modern policing, rooted in old totalitarian regimes, genocides, and slavery, if not the mere maintenance of authoritarian power structures through terrorism.

Police kill far, far more people than terrorists in the US and have killed over a hundred people more than mass shooters did in 2019 that we are aware of. Mass shooters are easily tracked.

Also, we can't forget about the Patriot Act and [Snowden's PRISM leaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program).

- The police, as an institution, are so completely steeped in violence, that [up to 40% of them commit acts of domestic violence and other forms of domestic abuse](http://womenandpolicing.com/violencefs.asp).

Why would I twist your words? My entire point was that you do not belive that, but the protestors do, therefore you do not completely support the protestors.

Is this a sarcastic answer or a genuine answer? Because if it is honest, then we've actually made some progress because I would agree with you. That person, even though they may be ignorant to the greater goings on within their organization, still works to allow the organization to continue existing and is therefore in some way complicit.

I just want to be clear, do you agree or was that sarcasm? Tone is difficult to detect over text and I don't want to ascribe beliefs to you that you do not hat.

If my analogy is unclear, I'd be happy to clarify it or lay out another, similar example.

&gt;Be realistic. These direct questions are so loaded, it's going to be arrested for a DUI.

Is my question completely unrelated to the concept of an institution being systemically bad? 

Remember, just because you agree that the gestapo guy is complicit, does not necessary mean you have to believe that is what is happening here. This is not a trap ""gotcha"" question. It's an analogy I am using to explore how someone can be individually innocent but still ""bad"" if they are part of a greater more evil system.

Again, agree with this does not mean that you necessarily have to believe that the US police system is *also* evil or just as evil/bad/toxic/whatever as the gestapo. Not at all! It is simply exploring how a person can be part of and complicit in the actions of the organizations they are a part of.

Maybe you don't agree, and you think Hans bears no responsibility of guilt for the crimes of other gestapo agents that he did not know about.

Let's take the clerk. A cop who is an out and out racist beats the shit out of and arrests a completely innocent black person. The clerk knows none of the details of this interaction, all they do is take the paperwork filled out by the cop (filled with lies about feeling like their life was in danger), put a stamp on it, and enter it into the system.

Did assist in the execution of a racist act? Are they completely removed from the racism of the cop, because from their position they did nothing overtly racist?

&gt;I'm asking you to prove this racism/discrimination, with a little bit more than ""this station/that station"".

I acknowledge some police stations have problems, you've yet to prove that the entire system or a majority of police stations do.

Listen to that... imagine if you and I worked together, as cops, and you were snorting coke in the evidence room and banging hookers on the street, I didn't know about this, your partner of 4 years, the person I'm supposed to trust, having this dark crime.

No, because again, you are making this an individual problem and not an institutional problem.

But I guess this is your answer, that you do not think Hans is culpable and there could be some good members of the gestapo. Is that an accurate represenatation of you response to my hypothetical?

I really don't think you should try to be a Moses Savior for these protesters if you can't even valid with data what their protests are. 

An institutional problem is a series of same classification of problems, happening everywhere. If it's happening everywhere, where is everywhere, a few articles of enclosed cases? 

I've purposely ignored the gestapo hans case, for one, I'm shocked you're reference a Nazi situation in a matter of racism, (an extreme viewpoint at that, but hey, media is using it with success right?)

Theres no implication of sarcasm, other than you are trying to be a voice for protesters in defining what they are standing for, but at face, you can't even support that with data, while trying to discredit anyone who disagrees. 

I'm not sure why you are worried about twisting/misrepresenting it now, kind of too late/deep in it now to cover those tracks.

That depends on ""member"" and ""complicit"", complicit being, are you trying to change them all with murder, even though one person did it?

Too many elements to consider, and not enough knowledge because (i dont know if this was intentional), you explained, what appears to be half of a story for the gestapo case. Explain it in full, or send a link. I really don't trust your point of view explanation, (in that you explain things that you want people to see, while dismissing often key points and hoping no one notices).

I'll counter-example.

Representatives of CHAZ may be considered for treason. Do you believe that all members of the organization, including the ones that were within boundaries that did not know of the new border limits, should be charged for treason, regardless of intention of overthrowing the government in that 16 block radius?

Selling to a drunk man, intentionally knowing, do you know the likihood of a car dealer either 

1. knowing if and how someone is drunk

2. selling said car if they are drunk, you realize they have checks on mental capacity, the same way if you buy a house/ get a tattoo, the chances are unlikely. 

So unless you are implying that everyone can pick up on personality traits/viewpoints/political opinions by... some kind of mind reading in public to assume that the population is totally aware and made of up.

1. People who are racist

Or 

2. People who know everyone else is racist.

Bro everybody knows Rev. Al Sharpton is a piece of shit, even he knows it. [He’s said it himself that he’s an attention seeker.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/al-sharpton-says-hes-not-an-ambulance-chaser-im-the-ambulance/2018/10/08/0417b81a-b059-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html%3foutputType=amp) And yeah he’s not very tact when it comes to speaking, but he has consistently been on the side of black Americans even when he- unfortunately- is at the expense of others.

Also bro these things are so old! It’s been 20 years, some of my beliefs have done 180s in just the past month, I can imagine 20 years will give a bit of reflection. 

Al Sharpton will never apologize in public because he’s a narcissist, but that doesn’t mean he holds genuine hate in his heart for certain people. 

[Al Sharpton doesn’t really hate Jews. ](https://www.stljewishlight.com/news/world/al-sharpton-gathers-black-leaders-for-meeting-with-ny-rabbi-in-wake-of-monsey-attack/article_a8993ec6-6f89-5ca5-8e0b-cf606d70d827.html) 

And also while it sucks that Al Sharpton was in the FBI, he said he did it to keep mobs out of his neighborhood,,, now do I believe that? Eh, could be true, it’s probably not, he probably just liked the money and lucrativeness, but whatever.

I’m not trying to defend Al Sharpton, but I am saying sometimes it’s not all or nothing. We’re human that’s just not how it works. What he’s doing right now is objectively good and we can’t change the past so we’re trying to make a better future, no matter who’s in charge.

(2) expresses its outrage over the violence that has resulted due to the Reverend Al Sharpton's incendiary words and actions; and
