Ok, I have to admit I haven't read the article- but if this is the 'insight' it delivers, it isn't exactly eye opening.

At the risk of introducing some potentially uncomfortable nuance to the discussion, it is not exactly accurate to lump in the economic realities faced by all ethnic minorities in the US under one heading. I couldn't find recent data from a quick search on household *wealth* by race, but in terms of *income* Asian households had over twice the average income of black households (87k vs 41k) and, notably, higher average incomes than white households (71K).

fst7byx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/gvwp12/how_big_is_the_racial_wealth_gap/fst7byx/,takatu_topi,"There is a lot to unpack here.

Over half of the human population is in Asia, and Asian-Americans are significantly more likely than white and black Americans to be immigrants, 2nd, or 3rd generation Americans. There is probably a good deal of self-selection, in which the more ambitious/capable/well educated people in China, Pakistan, India, ect. are much more likely than random members of the general population to immigrate to the US. It is perhaps less than politically-correct, but  find it likely cultural factors come in to play, at least to an extent.

This is something of an aside, but perhaps related: in 2011 students from non-English speaking African immigrant households performed better than English-speaking African American students on a standardized test:

There are significant differences in terms of average incomes of different Asian groups in the US based on national origin. Indian Americans are the highest earners of all ethnic groups (of course, there are various ethnicities within India, but Indian Americans tend to be Gujarati and Punjabi). Burmese are near the lower end of the spectrum, but I'd imagine most Burmese in the US are refugees.

Don’t get me wrong. My origin country can be racist in its own way but my dad went to an integrated school while kids here were being walked to school by the military. There were no lynchings and in the 60s a set of cops picked him up - to drive him home because it was late and unsafe. He didn’t grow up with this constant fear and thus he didn’t pass that on to us. We were poor when we left AND when we came to America. Now I’m looked at as ‘one of the good ones’ by white people: well spoken, well educated, well traveled but I’m sure it would have turned out differently if we were from here.

Again to dive deeper, just to build my own understanding which stems from lack of personal experiences, should any socio economic data exclude those who are 1st or 2nd generation immigrants?

I am able to pickup a theme here based on the couple of responses I read. Recent generation immigrants have a disproportionate advantage. So to understand the disparity of economic stature of African American population in the us, should we exclude the immigrants and try to understand the socio economic causes, or should we include the immigrants and try to understand the factors that allow them to get ahead?

Think about the cultural and linguistic loss. Of course, some elements of their indigenous west/central/southern African cultures survived within broader African American, and general American cultures, but the vast majority of cultural elements - languages, religions, social structures - were forcibly removed. It is a cultural genocide with few parallels in global history. They were literally dehumanized and commodified. This collective trauma would be hard to overcome even in the best of circumstances, but added to that have been additional subsequent generations of discrimination and marginalization.",-0.5859

ft4esqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/gvwp12/how_big_is_the_racial_wealth_gap/ft4esqb/,thewiseswirl,"So, the process took over ten years from the day my aunt requested it - when it started my dad was a single dad and when it ended he was married with two kids. You see that bill coming and find ways to handle it. We weren’t dirt poor but it was definitely barely making ends meet as his income was based on his sales (he was a traveling spice salesman, no high school degree, no car - just the bus and his legs) - I’m not entirely sure how he did it - but we always had food on the table and a whole lot of attention from our parents.

But you want to know about the actual moolah - it was a community effort really. Parents sold everything they had, my mom’s side gave what they could (dad’s side was immigrating as well) and that was enough for the flights. Upon arriving we stayed with our sponsor (my aunt) for a few months while we got our bearings but the 9 of us (my family and my other aunt’s family) left for our own place as soon as the adults and kids (everyone but me was a teenager or adult) got jobs. [There’s a bit to unpack in that last statement- our relationship with my aunt is solid and we’ll always owe her for it all but it was hustle mode from day one. Tiny example: we landed around 11:30pm and I was enrolled in school the next day (yup didn’t speak English).]*

Our first place on our own was magical (though admittedly not everyone had a proper room and our fridge for a while was a small styrofoam box). The 9 of us functioned essentially as a unit - whoever got paid helped with the food that week, the other family cooked it, and countless other things. Eventually everyone got better paying jobs and we split up again. My grandmother on my mom’s side was also a huge help. Mind you, this woman today has like a $300 pension and back then didn’t make much more but man is she good at finances (context: second grade grade education, can barely read, remembers the time before money, is probably sharper than all of us put together, has zip lined with me recently).

I was learning things that I had already learned in my home country. In a year I went from ESL to spelling bee champ to honors student.",0.9828
