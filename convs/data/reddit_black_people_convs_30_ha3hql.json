If Biden really wanted to give an olive branch to the left with his VP pick then it ain\u2019t her, the whole thing will reek of backroom fuckery that most on the left will assume was her promised reward for withholding her endorsement from Sanders and I wouldn\u2019t be at all shocked to find out that that\u2019s exactly what went down. \n\nIf he\u2019s at all serious about an olive branch to the left then he needs to look somewhere else, maybe Baldwin, she passes the sniff test for me, though I admit I don\u2019t know her nearly well enough to say that she\u2019d withstand any real scrutiny. I only paid her any attention very recently and it\u2019s because she\u2019s reportedly on his short list and one of the few on it that aren\u2019t immediately repellent. Just wish she wasn\u2019t in the Senate, I\u2019d hate to see her seat go GOP or corporatist if she left it. Her state is up in the air for the presidential race though so she\u2019d at the very least bring a bump there to the table, Mass isn\u2019t exactly in dire straits and in need of shoring up.",

We're not gonna do this. We're not politicizing. Everybody's got a primary you know. I'm sorry.\" \n\nBottom line. He really does not care.",
