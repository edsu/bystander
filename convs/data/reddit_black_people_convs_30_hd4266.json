More often than not the problem with a particular type of comedy involving specific groups is joke after joke that's intended to offend and attack, not the comedy which takes the piss out of stereotypes and perceptions which makes you think \"why does this x stereotype exist\" and this thought is actually stupid, like a social commentary on what's wrong with the world.\n\nI can't believe comedy has to be spelled out like the Vicar of Dibley has to do with Alice.

In fact Jim Davidson actually points out that black people are targeted for their skin colour at the start of his bit and refers to black people as cousins. That\u2019s positive. The offence is because he did an accent. When it comes to comedic value, it\u2019s not funny. Most of Jim Davidson\u2019s comedy isn\u2019t funny but that\u2019s besides the point of comedy. It\u2019s subjective.\n\nThe fact is many black comedians have done exactly this and to call to censor stereotyping is utterly ridiculous. All white people cannot dance? Come on, we know that\u2019s not true. As a sweeping generalisation it probably is though, the majority cannot. For comedic purposes it\u2019s hilarious. Why can\u2019t that be used in comedy? \n\nThe rocky stuff about Italians is brilliant too. The accent he has makes it even funnier.\n\nRichard Pryor\u2019s skit on white people\u2019s insults is absolutely hilarious. Of course that\u2019s stereotyping a race but it\u2019s funny. Especially in the accent he executes it in \n\nThe use of satire being considered offensive destroys comedy as an art form. \n\nI\u2019m not offended by the stereotypes.

The same joke delivered by a straight guy is considered homophobic and offensive. So a black guy ridiculing black people for the purpose of a joke is perfectly acceptable in that sense.\n\nHowever, many black comedians do stereotypical white guy impressions too.\n\nRichard Pryor, Eddie Murphy, Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock have all adopted stereotypical humour and using generalisations on white people in their routines, even adopting the accent. (like Jim Davidson did).\n\nYou know what? It\u2019s hilarious too. I don\u2019t find it offensive as a white person. \n\nI don\u2019t get what the difference is other than Jim Davidson isn\u2019t in their league for using the exact same techniques in comedy. He wasn\u2019t malicious, it wasn\u2019t hate-filled but the perception is different.  \n\nRichard Pryor didn\u2019t just do white stereotyping too, there\u2019s a funny skit where he talks about poverty and religion in India, adopting an Indian voice. Or a Chinese man with a stutter impression. Or his Italian American mafia impressions. \n\nOf course the perception is different, though.",
