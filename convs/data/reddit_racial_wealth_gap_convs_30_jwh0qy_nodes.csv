People will want to disagree, but actions speak louder than words:

As a Senator/Vice President he co-wrote and co-sponsored the following bills:

* A bill that created mandatory minimums, further impoverishing and immiserating those who lack the wealth to get charges dropped.
* A bill that applied those mandatory minimums solely to the mere possession of cheaper crack, and not more expensive cocaine, the same drug. Directly targeting Black communities for decimation of their working population and felonizing them, shutting them permanently out of good work
* a bill that reintroduced the death penalty, overwhelmingly applied to the poor. 
* a bill that introduced *sixty* new death penalty statutes. 
* a bill that made bankruptcy for the poor almost impossible, preventing the communities he destroyed from recovering, even if they somehow overcome the atrociously bigoted felonization. 
* multiple bills destroying Social Security that thankfully never passed. 
* countless bills enriching the wealthy, but never, not once, correcting the productivity/wages disparity that has kept wages flat, to the point that the current median wage is only $33k/y instead of $250k/y as it should be if wages matched productivity gains like they should. 

He targeted Black communities specifically and poor rural communities got caught up in the net with the opium crisis, impoverishing millions more. 

Biden is not your friend and he is the architect of the conditions that gave us Trump in the first place.",-0.9864
