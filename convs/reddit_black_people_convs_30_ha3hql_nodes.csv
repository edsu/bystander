But, even if this is true, it's just as bad as saying ""if I didn't have a primary I wouldn't care about Black people getting murdered"" because this is what he's basically saying by admitting if it weren't an election year he probably wouldn't even be there or at least he wouldn't care to be recognized or speak.
