The data is for whites vs nonwhites in the 1963 case, but breaking out black families should be similar.   \n\nPut another way, the median family wealth of white family increased by around 359% between 1963 and 2016.  For the median black family, it increased by 706%.\n\nThere is still a big disparity, but the trend is toward a smaller disparity.  What's shown in section 4 of the link supports that also, since younger people have a much smaller racial wealth than older people.",

Their verdicts are overturned more often, and they are more likely to put an innocent man in jail. If you are guilty of a crime, ask for a jury. If you are innocent, ask for a judge trial. \n\nYou still failed to demonstrate anything being \u201cfair.\u201d Fair is not accuracy. Fair is not correctness.\n\nI still maintain you will never be able to answer me because there is no such thing as fair. It is a fiction that children believe in like the Easter bunny.
