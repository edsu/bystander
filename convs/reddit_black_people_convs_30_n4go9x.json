You\u2019re right in the fact that the previous statement was racist, but the \u201cnot all men\u201d issue is backed by statistics showing that it is a very substantial number of them, and they may not even be 100% accurate because some people may not report incidents. It\u2019s not sexist to point at statistics that prove that it\u2019s not just a stereotype and base your thoughts and feelings on them, it\u2019s just looking at the facts and preparing for the worst.

      "text": "Alright so let\u2019s do some math.\n\nTotal US population = 328.2 million\n\n13.4% of the total US population is black so around 43,987,800 people in the US are black, cool.\n\nThe total number of offenses committed BY blacks is around 2,667,010 (whites are much higher with 7,014,550 meaning your \u201cthey commit more crimes on average\u201d comment doesn\u2019t work here) which means that only 2.8% of the black population commits a crime (and some of them could be repeat offenders)\n\nSo essentially 2.8% of 13% of the total US population could be trouble. Pretty small right? Now let\u2019s look at some rape statistics.\n\nAgain, Total US population = 328.2 million\n\nMen make up 49% of the total US population meaning roughly 157 million dudes are vibin here. That\u2019s already a much bigger number right? It doesn\u2019t stop there.\n\nRoughly 91% of women have to deal with sexual assault and seeing as how someone has to make up the other 51% of the population (164 million) we can figure out that 149,240,000 women are raped or sexually assaulted. Okay thats a scary large number, so what percent of rapists have victims described as men?\n\n99%. 99% of offenders described in these circumstances were male, meaning that roughly 147,747,600 were carried out by men. \n\n45% of the total US population have been offenders in some kind of sexual harassment or assault. When you say \u201cit\u2019s not all men\u201d sure, you\u2019re right, but there are HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS who are guilty of this. It\u2019s unfair to look at 2.8% of the population and be weary of them, because it\u2019s such a tiny section of the bigger picture. Yes they exist, but the chances of you ever running into someone like that is low. Now just consider for a second that HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of women have ALREADY been affected and have had encounters like this, and 45% of the entire population have been the ones to start these encounters. You\u2019ve never had an issue with someone of another race but you\u2019ve probably met a male that\u2019s engaged in some kind of sexual harassment in your lifetime and you will further into the future. The statistics are nowhere near the same and they can\u2019t at all be compared. Fearing 2.8% of 13% the population vs 45% is in no way comparable, and I think that women have plenty of justification for being weary after doing this math.\n\nSources Cited:\n\nhttps://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/crime/ucr.asp?table_in=2\n\nhttps://www.unwomenuk.org/safe-spaces-now\n\nhttps://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF\n\n(Edit: Yes I did take an entire hour to write all of this out and do the math)\n\nEdit part 2: It\u2019s actually 97% of women. So allow me to rework my math for a second. \n\n159,080,000 women are victims of sexual harassment or assault meaning that around 157,489,200 men have engaged in some form of this. \n\nTHATS 48% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION THAT WOMEN HAVE ALREADY BEEN HARASSED AND ASSAULTED BY.",

From your logic, we understand that:\n\nif men disproportionately commit rape and sexual assault (which they do), it makes sense to be cautious around them\n\nif black people disproportionately commit crime (which they do), it makes sense to be cautious around them as well, even if you are just slightly more cautious\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHowever, it seems that there is some threshold you have for when it is okay to be careful around a type of person.

You\u2019re not likely to meet any of them, and if you do then they most likely wouldn\u2019t do anything to harm you any way so being nervous about the entire race is in fact racist. And I specifically mentioned that I was talking about sexual harassment AND assault. If it was just sexual assault then yes 99% would be an extreme, but I included sexual harassment because that is also an issue that needs to be addressed. I would like to ask why the math is irrelevant considering the fact that it proves that you objectively have no reason to fear black people and completely explains why women would be so cautious around men. You\u2019re simply taking the things I say and finding what you want to hear and then acting as if that was my entire argument, when in fact by reviewing what I wrote it should be abundantly obvious that I was trying to dissuade you from being cautious around black people entirely. Instead of spending your time trying to make my argument invalid, I would like you to feel some empathy for women and understand where they\u2019re coming from when they say these kinds of things and try to help change things so it\u2019s safer for everyone instead of immediately calling them sexist.\n\nEdit: It just occurred to me that you didn\u2019t even try to understand the math if you\u2019re assuming that i\u2019m saying that 99% of men are offenders. 99% of sexual assault and harassment are committed by men, that doesn\u2019t mean 99% of men it just means 99% of the total number of assaults were committed by men.",

Then we can apply the real-world scenario afterwards.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf I was making your argument, this is how I would do it:\n\nI think it is important to balance your personal feeling of safety and the harm you might do to others or a group of people.\n\nFor example, if you were to clutch your purse when a black person was approaching in a public place (which in SOME LOGICAL WAY does make sense, since your are somewhat MORE LIKELY to be robbed by that black person than a white person, on average), it is still a racist and bad thing to do. Why? Because the chance of you actually being robbed is still very low, and your action perpetuates a stereotype that black people are criminals and thugs, which is harmful in the long run. Your fear of being robbed is significantly exaggerated due to your racism, and your actions are unwarranted.\n\nOn the other hand, if you were a women walking alone at night and a man is approaching, there might be a pretty significant chance of something bad happening to you. The risk is significant enough that it does warrant action, and the harm done to men by perpetuating a stereotype is somewhat negligible.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you take this position, however, you also have to accept that, if we lived in a hypothetical world where black people committed a massive amount of crime, it would be okay to engage in behavior considered racist by today's standards.
