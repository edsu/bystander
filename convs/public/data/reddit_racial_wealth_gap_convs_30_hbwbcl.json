Data is important but so are qualitative measures, so is analysis. I would discourage following numbers blindly.\n\nI wouldn't go as far as formulating the policy. I don't know if UK's police is racist systematically or not. What I'm trying to say is that if  people of a particular skin color have universally worse outcomes, they are without a doubt underprivileged and so it should be looked into.\n\nTo your point, poor people have dismal outcomes too, and white working class boys are just a subclass of those. We don't call it discrimination, but no matter how you put it they are on the receiving end of inequality and should be helped perhaps by reducing inequality.\n\nHowever, poor and BAME are two distinct groups, somewhere intersecting, and problems of both groups should be solved.\n\nIt's not a dichotomy. You can't say let's solve problems of the poor instead of BAME and maybe BAME would feel better in the process. You have two work with both.",

They are discriminated against by a system which tends to ignore poverty ... I mean, look at the number of years of Tory (and Tory ish) rule.  \n\nMy sense is that of the problems, it's 90pc class, 10pc race.  Looking at crime, where there are race significance it is still small differences that wouldn't really change headline numbers if removed.  That should not stop them from being removed.  But we would still be having all these conversations if the courts were colourblind, because I'm not aware of anyone saying that a disproportionate amount of crime isn't being committed by BAME.",
