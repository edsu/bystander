Then, each family’s annual income would be used—given the lack of data collected by the government on family wealth—as the basis for the sliding scale to determine the amount of each annual contribution to the child’s endowment. 

Honestly can't tell if this is trying to fail? 

I can already hear people complaining that the poor kids graduate high school with a slush fund while the middle class kids get stiffed by their parents.

The first is that if we raised $60B more in annual taxes, I think that we could help people without means much more effectively than by just sequestering this money away for 18 years. 

If a poor kid grows up in the a dangerous neighborhood with bad schools and a single parent without time to read to him because of her three jobs, etc....getting $40k at age 18 won't really make much of a difference. 

Relatedly, there's nothing in the article suggesting that the result of all of this wouldn't just be a bunch of 18 year olds driving really nice new cars. 

Also, there's a typo in the linked article, I think:
