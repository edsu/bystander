Of course you notice someone's skin color, hair color, hair style, height, general body shape, etc etc. Your eyes and brain do this with no conscious input or effort. Pretending that your eyes don't work is just dumb and simplistic.

The issue is the subjective associations that go along with every objective physical attribute, often ones that operate subconsciously or even in conflict with our conscious thoughts or ideals of who we want to be. What people are trying to say with the stupid phrase (I think) is that they have overcome the subjective associations and see/treat people as individuals rather than as representatives of a particular group.",-0.8807

Then realize that racism is deeply rooted and understand where it comes from. So if you say you don't see color you can end up erasing certain facts about who I am. 

Example: Talking to your darker black friend about tanning and asking them to join you so they can also tan. 

A person that doesn't see color might think they are including their black friend. But this is a pretty dumb thing to say to a person who was born with all the melanin they need. A person who respects the color of a black persons skin might say, ""Are you cool with hanging out while I tan? I don't want you to be bored and there's other things to do at this beach."" Or something like this.",0.8468
