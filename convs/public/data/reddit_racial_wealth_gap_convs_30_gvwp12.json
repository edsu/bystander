You see that bill coming and find ways to handle it. We weren\u2019t dirt poor but it was definitely barely making ends meet as his income was based on his sales (he was a traveling spice salesman, no high school degree, no car - just the bus and his legs) - I\u2019m not entirely sure how he did it - but we always had food on the table and a whole lot of attention from our parents.\n\nBut you want to know about the actual moolah - it was a community effort really. Parents sold everything they had, my mom\u2019s side gave what they could (dad\u2019s side was immigrating as well) and that was enough for the flights. Upon arriving we stayed with our sponsor (my aunt) for a few months while we got our bearings but the 9 of us (my family and my other aunt\u2019s family) left for our own place as soon as the adults and kids (everyone but me was a teenager or adult) got jobs. [There\u2019s a bit to unpack in that last statement- our relationship with my aunt is solid and we\u2019ll always owe her for it all but it was hustle mode from day one. Tiny example: we landed around 11:30pm and I was enrolled in school the next day (yup didn\u2019t speak English).]*\n\nOur first place on our own was magical (though admittedly not everyone had a proper room and our fridge for a while was a small styrofoam box). The 9 of us functioned essentially as a unit - whoever got paid helped with the food that week, the other family cooked it, and countless other things. Eventually everyone got better paying jobs and we split up again. My grandmother on my mom\u2019s side was also a huge help. Mind you, this woman today has like a $300 pension and back then didn\u2019t make much more but man is she good at finances (context: second grade grade education, can barely read, remembers the time before money, is probably sharper than all of us put together, has zip lined with me recently). \n\n*Note: Because of the language issue and when I arrived I had to repeat kindergarten, however, I noticed very early on that the US was behind education wise. I was learning things that I had already learned in my home country. In a year I went from ESL to spelling bee champ to honors student.",
