I recall the faux controversy a few years ago about #KillAllWhiteMen or Diane Abbott’s 2012 comments about “white people love to divide and rule.” The reversed racism/sexism just doesn’t carry the same ‘sting’…,0.7506

A lot of people tweeting that it’s unacceptable for him to tweet something about Priti Patel that he wouldn’t tweet about Boris Johnson.\n\nBut what if he had tweeted “deport Boris”? Does that make it OK to tweet the same about Priti?,-0.1096

Like May, I'm white with an English accent. I'd just laugh incredulously if someone suggested deporting me. It's completely different when you're talking about a woman of colour.",0.5719

That looks like a dozen tweets in a decade suggests its enormously less common.
