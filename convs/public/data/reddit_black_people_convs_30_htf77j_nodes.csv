But for what it's worth, Israel is home to both an Ethiopian Jewish community, as well as a [Black Hebrew Israelite community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Hebrew_Israelites_of_Jerusalem) (generally not considered Jewish).",0.6124

That's why they forcefully sterilize them, discriminate against them in housing and ask if they're really ""Jewish"" enough (whatever that means) to lay claim to Israel in the first place.

As for the ""Black Hebrew Israelite"" community....give us both a fucking break. Nice job patting yourself on the back for not thinking you're as bigoted as you really are though, I guess :/",0.9416
