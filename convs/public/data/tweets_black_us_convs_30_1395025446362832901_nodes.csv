I’m not about to belittle the contributions of Natives or the fact that people like me did unconsciousable things to people like you. But 1619 was created for the 400th anniversary of the first slave ship. It is what it is, not what it isn’t.",0.6911

The 1619 project dares to acknowledge slavery and Black American's role in our country's founding. The UNC system should do the same. Instead, we had Silent Sam for 100 years and the Unsung Founders Memorial is the height of a stepstool. https://t.co/aaAj0XqoGl",-0.8126
