The real people they are pandering to are the wealthy liberal donors who want to absolve themselves of their wealth guilt by pushing policies and narratives that will have no impact on them but disproportionately impact the middle and lower classes. Look at how all that liberal wealth ruined KUOW, Crosscut, etc. By pushing racist narratives they get to distract from the fact they have too much money.",
