I'd argue that, *while BLM was a reaction,* it isn't [reactionary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary).  And BLM isn't about superiority, it's about parity.

The phrase ""black lives matter"" is a tragic affirmation of a reality that *should* be self-evident and a complaint about a culture that seems willing to ignore the corrosive effects of structural racism whether in general, or in the specific context of police brutality.

And while it's absolutely true that the police aren't responsible for structural racism- though some of them [helped build the structures](https://time.com/4779112/police-history-origins/)- they receive focus because the murder of a specific black person by a specific police officer is shocking, immediate, and relatable in a way that a broader discussion of say, [redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining), is not.",-0.9539
