Everybody always wants to cut the police department but the reason the police department doesn't suck horribly is because they try really hard to not have people working 18-hour shift for 10 days in a row, which tends to make you cranky and short-tempered and it generally have bad judgment.\n\nI really understand the sentiment because why do you want to reward these assholes? but the end results speak for themselves.\n\nlately I'm seeing people declare that we should be cutting the Oakland police budget but I don't think that's the right direction to go. If you pay people better you can be a lot pickier about who you hire and you don't have to have people working double shifts as a regular thing.\n\nIt's counterintuitive but it can workout better to give law enforcement more resources. what are the things that Richmond did was have mental health professionals available for every single shift for instance. They also started requiring arms training every six weeks instead of the once or twice a year. He had a no chase policy and instead surrounded in an area and moved in methodically from all sides which makes things really boring and then there's no adrenaline on either side.\n\nEDIT sorry for the typos.

But this strikes me as the kind of record that the city contract, policies, and oversight mechanisms should *not* be seen tolerating. It totally undermines trust in the force and its accountability structure. Details aside, if the proof's in the pudding, this is shit pudding.\n\nEither do the substantial work to show this individual's record isn't as bad as it predictably seems, or let the officer go. If they lack the resources to do the work, and feel dismissal would be unfair to the individual, I understand that. Public trust and accountability in the institution have to override the individual interest.\n\nI'm a lawyer. I worked hard for it, and I do the best I can. But it is not my right to be a lawyer. I don't like the idea of having my career cut short for the greater good. And I bristle at some of the dumber, broad-brush parts of professional oversight. But I have no doubt that's the kind of policy my profession should follow, when it comes to that. I think we've done a fair job of preserving trust despite competence problems and criminal conduct. I think we've a long, long way to go regaining legitimacy in terms of fairness, service, and access.\n\nI'm angry at the police department. I was before these protests. And I never want to compare my own anger or pain to anyone else's. I don't want to pretend that I know exactly what you mean by \"ACAB\", or how you mean to use it for change.\n\nI happen to believe there are very good individuals in police departments, including, incredibly, OPD and Alameda Sheriffs. But I look at that organization and wonder how the Hell people who *are* good can *be* good through that institution and culture. I suspect it's as hard or harder to be a good cop at OPD as a bad cop. What's worse, I suspect it's easier than anything to simply be no particular kind of person at all, and just do what's required, step by step, by whatever book, without investing any humanity to speak of. A lot of us have had a job like that, and know what kind of work we tended to do. This one involves weapons and criminals.\n\nI'd sure go for a few good conversations with officers, or watching good conversations recorded with others.

      "text": "I am speaking of the current iteration of liberalism, that which has always existed. First and foremost, I am speaking for myself, a liberal.\n\nLiberalism wants to work within the framework of the state when it can effectively do so, even when acknowledging the state's shortcomings. Oftentimes even when those shortcomings are severe. Liberals do not consider operating within the mechanisms of the state to inherently be an endorsement of those shortcomings, under the justification that they are doing so specifically to try to address and reform those shortcomings. When the state does not permit reform to occur, liberalism compels revolution against that state.\n\nLiberals in America do not believe we are at that point yet, but are headed in that direction, and so are frantically trying to take back the reins so we can reform the system to prevent this form of Trumpian fascism from getting control again.\n\nLiberalism is also not a set of policy goals, but it is an approach to statemaking driven by liberty, egalitarianism, and consent of the governed. Liberalism allows for a set of beliefs to be advocated in one era and opposed in another, because, being a project of continual improvement and reform, it allows for reform even of its own sets of policies.\n\nLiberalism is not opposition to a slate of policies any more than it is support of a slate of policies. It is a method to consider policies, and a process for implementing them.\n\nIlliberal leftists see cooperation with a state with severe shortcomings as inherently an endorsement of the shortcomings of the state. They believe a state with severe shortcomings must be torn apart from the outside and replaced with a more favorable state or system.\n\nThis is why I maintain with absolute certainty that being a liberal does not make you a fascist, and in fact, requires you to be vehemently opposed to fascism, despite the fact that I consider Trump to be a fascist while I also still believe we can salvage the American experiment from his rule.\n\nIt's also why you maintain that there is no difference between being a liberal and a fascist, which, to me, is patently absurd.",

Especially for things like affordable housing and homeless shelters.\n\n&gt;I see liberals as the same as Germans in ww2 who were not affiliated  with the nazi party, but didn't actively fight against it.  Looking  back, we know know they were just as bad.\n\nI wasn't going to get into Godwin's Law, but since you did it first, here's my take:\n\nErnst Th\u00e4lmann, the leader of the KPD (German Socialists in the Weimar Republic) believed that the SPD (the Social Democrats, liberals) were a greater threat to their goals of revolution that fascism, because they promised the people reform without destroying the capitalist state. He preferred working against Hitler's party because he believed this would compel the people to join his revolution. So he refused to form a coalition government with the liberals, which would've denied Hitler a plurality coalition in the Reichstag.\n\n[https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2018/10/how-left-enabled-fascism](https://www.newstatesman.com/world/europe/2018/10/how-left-enabled-fascism)\n\nAs you might imagine, I have an agenda here drawing a parallel to whether the American far left has an obligation to help Biden defeat Trump, even if he's not our perfect candidate.\n\nedit:\n\n&gt;They are towing the line\n\n(it's actually \"toeing\" the line.)\n\nAnd FWIW I am opposed to our system of law enforcement pretty much in its entirety.\n\nI'm not as keen to attribute people's actions to their agency and individual choice so much as the systems and the environment they exist in, which I think people systematically underestimate as factors. So I think the conversation about whether \"cops\" are bad is kind of missing the point. The system and the environment they operate in is very obviously bad, so to me that's the main point. We need to reform the system so dramatically that I'm closer to advocating for tearing the whole thing apart and starting over than I am in favor of passing piecemeal reform, in that area, specifically.",

      "text": "The problem is \"good\" is a variable depending on who you talk to.  By traditional policing standards, they're all\"good\" cops.  We know what that means.  Hired goons and mercenaries shouldn't be on the city payroll.  If they were hired and trained to do beat-walks, deescalation and social work that actually prevented poverty and fixed social problems, it would still be too much but it would be easier to look the other way.  \n\nWe have to consider that there is a segment of the population that actually enjoys beating people up for money and power-tripping AND that these are the most likely to become cops.  The policing system rewards bullying and graft.",

Since joining OPD in the late 1990s, Gonzales has featured in some of OPD\u2019s most controversial moments, from a police assault on unarmed protesters opposing the Iraq War in 2003 and the shooting of cop-killing parolee Lovelle Mixon to the department\u2019s violent response to Occupy Oakland. He has been involved in four officer-involved shootings over the years, and the city has paid out $3.6 million to date in legal settlements for incidents in which Gonzales played a part.",
