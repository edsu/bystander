If we give East Asians credit for low crime in America, why shouldn't we blame Black Americans for high crime?

Was being Asian what caused these people to create these companies? Likewise Does Being Black cause people to commit crime? If not, why would we attribute race to success?",0.6415

They have founded or co-founded start-ups, which later turned into big companies. As a result, East-Asians have created numerous jobs.
