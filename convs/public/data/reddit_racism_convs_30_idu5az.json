I use \u201cwhite\u201d because the majority of the population is of that racial orientation. \n\nHonestly most of it isn\u2019t very overt. It\u2019s more discomfort. Most of the homeless drug addicts down town happen to be aboriginal, and there is a very clear social and economic divide. Most people individually aren\u2019t racist, a lot of it is just a defense mechanism for being implied to be racist due to social and economic forces outside of their control. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m originally from the Calgary area, and I don\u2019t think Lethbridge is really any more or less racist than there. But, I\u2019m also a white male who doesn\u2019t really hang out with racist people. So maybe I just have sample bias.",

Some of them worked at the mall and saw a lot of shit they caused. \n\nMind you, when my wife moved in with me, we had a super nice native lady as our neighbor and it changed her perception of natives. When she moved here for the first few years the only native people she met were the sketchy drugged out homeless people down town. She didn't really interact with any normal natives who live normal lives. And im guessing a lot of people fall into that.",

Alberta had more kids in res school that other provinces.

Actual people, many of whom are part of respected professions were involved.\n\nOdds are you know people who were involved in one capacity or an other. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the dilemma right here- that racism is here, we grew up with it, we live with it and we need to all acknowledge the racism within us and try and change.",

We don't want hear the opinions of minorities if it doesn't support the self hating, virtue signaling white narrative. Clearly if you move here from a foreign land it's fine if you don't like the natives because as an ignorant immigrant, you just don't understand. If someone moves from a small Saskatchewan town and comes to the same conclusions that person should know better because they are white and smaht and privileged.",

      "text": "Hopefully this post won\u2019t offend anyone because it\u2019s purpose is to be an open ended conversation and non argumentative. It\u2019s a very sensitive topic but the post is to spark genuine discussion and conversation.\n\nI saw a post earlier on the sub bringing up racism and the post had a fair bit of buzz which got me thinking I wasn\u2019t alone in the whole \u201cLethbridge racism\u201d thing. It was something I always felt was around and would casually joke with friends about it, but never really got anyone\u2019s genuine experiences on the matter. However, Seeing the post earlier made me interested in what other peoples experiences were on the topic. Growing up in Calgary half of my life left me with a lot of mixed experiences on the matter, but moving to Lethbridge last year made me feel more uncomfortable than I\u2019d ever been in Calgary. There was never any overt experiences I could really attribute to these feelings other than a lot of mistreatment and bullying by new peers\u2014but I\u2019d never feel comfortable jumping to \u201cracism\u201d. \n\nAnother matter different from Calgary (south) is that there\u2019s a high number of indigenous people, toward whom Ive unfortunately heard more racist comments thrown at than any other place I\u2019ve been to. There were always similar hostilities in Calgary, but it feels distinctly greater out here. \n\nWhat are others experiences on the whole topic of racism down here in Lethbridge?",
