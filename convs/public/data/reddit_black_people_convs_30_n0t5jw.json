Were the people killed doing something to provoke the police? If they actually said nothing and put their hands up would they have been killed? I mean, are cops just stopping these people with the intent on killing them even before stopping them? EVEN if they were provoking and being rude to the cops it shouldn\u2019t matter, no bullets should have been shot.",
