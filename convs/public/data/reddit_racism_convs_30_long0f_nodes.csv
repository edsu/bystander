And assigning some base level of value and dignity on every person independently from the job they do in society.

It's one thing to say ""my race matters"" but if you are also saying ""be less of that other race"" then you are just asking for cultural conflict. Every culture has some things to be proud of and some things to be ashamed of. You can't call people hateful for bashing your culture while simultaneously bashing other cultures.

Just be civil and treat *individuals* with as much trust and respect as they *personally* have earned regardless of their culture, religion, job, health, or skin color. If you can do that, then we don't need to have all these culture wars.",0.892
