Your race, height, age aren't social constructs. They are tangible concepts with real bearing outside of our society. You can't identify as a skin color you don't have. You can't identify as a height you aren't. You can't identify as an age you body isn't.

""But boys and girls have different anatomy"" you say? No. Males and females have different anatomy. Men and women don't as being masculine or feminine is based on arbitrary and abstract concepts, ideas, and actions that we do, not by what genitals we have. The color blue doesn't have a penis. Playing with dolls doesn't have a vagina. It doesn't matter if a man or woman does either of these things as it bears no real meaning on said action.",-0.205

Height and age and skin colour are externally verifiable facts; there's no separate internal representation that might identify differently.",-0.296

Some of them just like to complicate things too much because their life might be somehow bland or it's a reason to divert their attention or loneliness. Sometimes standards of the society can be irritating but at the same time you yourself could also have some preferences but atleast few people don't obsess on it that much. Just my observation though",0.2542
