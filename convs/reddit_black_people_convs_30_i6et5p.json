This sub is meant for users like you to ask genuine questions, so please don't ask jokes or rants disguised as questions. While you can ask almost anything here, please keep illegal and loaded questions off this sub to give others a good experience and ask medical questions in more appropriate places.\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NoStupidQuestions) if you have any questions or concerns.*",
