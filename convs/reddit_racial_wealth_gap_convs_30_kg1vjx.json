The beneficiaries of the policy would all be unable to vote for 18 years. That could be 18 years with many crises tempting governments to raid/cut the baby bond program. Even the beneficiaries may not think much of money they can't spend now - people are terrible at delayed gratification. \n\nThe Blair government implemented such a plan in Britain in the early 00s.
